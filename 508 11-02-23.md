Network causal inference

Suppose we have spillovers. ATE is hard to even think about. 
- $Y_{i1}$ is not a number anymore
- can compute avg of treated minus untreated: is the average of the marginal effects of treating the marginal person, conditional on the other treatments you are doing

So we want to create something called 'exposure map'
let Z be all possible assignments
then $f(Z; \theta_i)$ is an 'exposure mapping' which is a function of all possible treatment statuses that reduces the dimension of it 
ex: advertisement shown to 1 person in a network of max degree 1
then you're either 'directly' exposed, 'indirectly' exposed, or'true control'
If assignment probability known, exposure mapping gives you known probabilities
each exposure status x unit combo has a potential outcome

HT estimator is unbiased since the probabilities are not straightforward but known

--------------------------
take any dataset, pretend it is the control of an experiment (it is!) the uniformity trial
ask how estimators would perform if we _had_ run a randomized experiment on that population simulating only treatment assignments and causal effects

e.g take some network
choose 1/5 of elements to be 'treated' 
adjacency matrix with 0 on diagonal
Exposure mapping = 
$$ 
\begin{cases}
10 \text{ Isolated Direct }& \text{you are treated but no friends} \\
01 \text{ Indirect }& \text{friends treated} \\
11 \text{ Direct and Indirect }& \text{both you and friends} \\
00 \text{ Control}& \text{neither you nor friends}
\end{cases}
$$
can simulate all the possible treatment assignments and see the probability any person gets into any particular group
