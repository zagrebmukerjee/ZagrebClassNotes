Stylized fact: development -> reduced labor forced participation (a U shape) (Goldin studies this)
Rsch from rural india

candidate hypotheses:
- new jobs distasteful
- leisure
- returns to home production (invest in kids) go up
- social norms
- status concerns

in India, the status

status is about hierarchy, not just horizontally (ie the sub castes).
so upper vs lower castes

> aside - on non fundamentally driven rsch. "you can't build scientific knowledge that way. It'll be like papers in psychology - just finding one thing after another. Not bringing things together"

Social status matters for allocating non-market goods and services. In a developing country that can be a lot!

this creates behaviours (ex Veblen) oriented around conspicuous consumption (incl of leisure) - weiss and fershtman, 1998
another way would be to signal that women don't need to work 

But then why does this happen with economic development? It means returns to status must change with development. Why?

> example: status gets you front row of church, development increases church size, more valuable to be in front row

But also development marketizes more goods, decreasing the space in which status can be used

measure ag productivity by pop density instrumented by FAO crop yields. increasing in FLFNP cross country in all Asia but not africa. True also across districts in India

stratification requires elites and non elites. james scott stuff
(Goody 1971 status group endogamy - status assortative mating - is a prerequisite for strata)
Srinivas (1956, 57) - after development in india, "Sanskritization" - low castes attempt to raise social position by emulating high caste behaviour. also example: women withdraw from labor force. Also ritual purity stuff: vegetarianism, teetotalism

If this is the case we can actually observe vegetarianism, teetotalism and say this is actually about status (or not)


note: huge variation, 40-90 percent, in 1950s; flattens a lot in 2000s
find pop density strongly predicts female non participation, not male. with time and trend FEs. 
same with vegetarianism, teetotal: predicted by density (but what if density means poorer places? no. nor are meat and alcohol more expensive)
most alternative explanations do not explain veg and teetotal
a sharp diff: wages for women rise with pop density. 



## Model

key moving part is the social status buying you goods 
population H, L
group of N hh
households in group $i$ have endowment $y_i$
$y_H > y_L$ but extent is private information

HHs derive utility from mkt and nonmkt goods; 
status signalled by $c_i$ which allocates shares of the non market good, which has per capita value $v$. there is total pot of $2N v$. then we divvy it up
