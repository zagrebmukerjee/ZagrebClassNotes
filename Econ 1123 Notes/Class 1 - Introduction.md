### [[Class 1 - Introduction]]
Part of [[@Econ S1123 Index]]

Mostly review of things I already knew and will learn again 

Few pieces of content:

Reminder: sample vs population mean. Pop mean, true mean, denoted $\mu$. Sample mean is $\bar{x}$, where $\bar{x} = \sum x_i/n$.

Sample vs population variance: Pop var $\sigma^2$ is $\sum(x_i - \mu)^2/n$. Sample var $\sqrt{\sum(x_i - \mu)^2/(n-1)}$. Why $n-1$? To make it an unbiased estimator of population variance. Pop Stdev is $\sigma$, sample is $S_x$. 

```ad-info
title: $n-1$ details - TODO
$\sqrt{\sum(x_i - \mu)^2/(n)}$ is biased because...

Z score: $(x_i - \bar{x})/S_x$
