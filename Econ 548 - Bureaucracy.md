# [[Econ 548 - State Capacity and Bureaucracy]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>
[[Bureaucracy]]
[[State Capacity]]

State capacity per economists - administrative state

Bureaucracy score from VDEM: meritocracy, rigorous and impartial adminstration index (probably a bit soft as a measure per RP)

<font color=#F7B801>state capacity to do what? Capacity, or governance?</font>
<font color=#F7B801>who is on the inside of bureaucracy</font>
<font color=#F7B801>what is the point of this concept</font>

Econ thinks of this like agency: state wants to eg. gain control of territory or raise taxes but needs bureaucrats
- Fukuyama 2004: implementation. can the state do what it wants; can it do so cleanly and transparently

## Who Becomes a Bureaucrat
selection - how does it differ from private sector - do governments have longer time horizons? (shareholder etc) <font color=#F7B801>but what about changes in leadership. How many Presidents has Tim Apple seen</font> 
- ex: civil service jobs frequently offer stabiity, tenure, pension. Why is that? Capacity to make promises?
- Patronage - emphasis on formulaic hiring. limited pay for performance in modern, west
- state runs itself. ex congress is exempt from obamacare or what have you
- mission statement confused




### State of Literature: Selection

who do I get
- compensation comparison. need to hold occupation category fixed
[[Finan, Olken, and Pande 2015 The personnel economics of the state|Finan, Olken, and Pande 2015]]


what's relationship btwn wages and who they get. can you get higher ability people
- problem is that there is harder-to-observe 'public service motivation'
- is that correlated with ability? Who knows? <font color=#F7B801>the right model I think is compensating differentials</font>
	- if uncorrelated: would actually expect lower PSM with wage raising (if ability $\propto$ reservation wage)
	-

Selection exam - how does it change the general labor market? A hiring freeze in Tamil Nadu appeared to create an increase in unemployment as people were wasting time studying for an exam they would fail - Mangal 2020


Paper finds a pattern: governor more connected to the secretary of state gets more rents, produces less revenue. 


Paper: Brazil is 'most meritocratic', potentially a lower bound on corruption? can identify patronage in certain settings and finds there are welfare costs of patronage and impacts on qualification and turnover
<font color=#F7B801> lots of people work on Brazil b/c there is great data to be had there</font>


## What Do They Do

literature on whether incentive based pay changes outcomes: very mixed
