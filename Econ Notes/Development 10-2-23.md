## Schooling: Agriculture

Returns to schooling

- Minimal mobility across the landed/unlanded barrier in India (ARIS 1982 and REDS 1999 Panel)
- Estimate $\tau_{ij}$ residuals from predicting profit cahnge, net of changes in: assets, px, weather, asset returns
- $\tau$ has measurement error. attenuation bias
- use it as an instrument to predict yield, yield growth which have uncorrelated yield growth
- does growth in yield affect changes in school enrollment

yield growth goes up almost $40\%$ from 1971 to 1982


green revolution regressive; benefit w/ large landholders, they were early adopters, and schooling levels diverged which then (if y believe previous studies) boosts yields also

puzzle: women were also sent to school more often. 
- (schooling valuable. w/fixed effects on HH, dowry much lower for literate/primary school daughters)
- answer: the women who are literate can teach the sons and augment/replace schooling

## Schooling: Globalization

- for more than 100 yrs bombay was blue collar town with subcaste networks + referrals the main structuring
- structural transformation 1980s-2000 -> prominence of trade, finance, corporates etc
- english skills become valuable. Raises importance of a choice: go to private school, expensive, and learn English or go to local school, free, and learn Marathi

Can quantify returns to english with mincer wage education + a dummy for english. Big! rise in returns to English (15% return to the fixed effect -> 23% for men. Women who work - english used to be null, now also 25%), not rise in return for schooling period

Pre-reform, english schooling in upper caste, who are wealthier, is 15x higher than lower castes in both genders
- was the globalization equalizing? there are barriers for poorer/lower castes to access schooling
- for girls there is convergence in enrollment
- for boys - 40% to 80% of high caste boys go to English school, and <10% to 30%. No convergence
- more HH fixed effects rules out a lot of basics
- why?

Castes: occupational specialization for men (not women) and referrals (esp for professionals -> brahmin dominance self sustaining)
Model this with a network externality and see if that explains school choice
- Munshi's own neighborhood

Wage in blue collar jobs scales w/ average productivity, not individual
model: 3 equilibria for each jati - 
1) everyone in jati goes to local school
2) only high ability types choose english schools
3) only low ability types chose local schoos
