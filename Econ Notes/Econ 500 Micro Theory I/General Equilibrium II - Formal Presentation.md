# [[General Equilibrium II - Formal Presentation]]

[[Econ 500 Micro Theory Index]]

## Setup

We're interested in formally presenting and demonstrating many of the conclusions drawn from the Edgeworth Box framework. In particular, we're going to introduce more than two consumers, and we will also introduce firms and profit-maximization. 

1) There are $I$ consumers, $J$ firms, and $L$ commodities, all positive. 
2) Each consumer has a consumption set $X_i$ and a preference relation $\succsim_i$ defined on $X_i \times X_i$. Assume $X_i$ is closed, and bounded below ($\forall i \;; \exists \; r_i \in \R^L$ s.t. $X_i \subseteq r_i + \R^L_+$ 
3) Each firm has some prouction set $Y_j$ such that $Y_j \subseteq \R^L_-$; 
	1) There's a total production set $Y$ which we write $Y = \sum_j Y_j$: this just means every firm is producing something from their set. Formally $y\in Y \iff \exists\,c \in \R^J \text{s.t.} c'(y_1, \ldots, y_j)
