# [[General Equilibrium IIa - Generalized Existence]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>

In [[General Equilibrium II - Existence]] a specific case is discussed with restrictions on the economy <font color=#F7B801>what</font>

This argument gives a more general treatment. 

## Setup

### Quasiequilibrium 
Reference: definition 
Now  introduce a notion of Walrasian Quasiequilibrium. 


==== waiting for sync ====


Suppose a WQE $x^*, y^*, p$; suppose convex consumption sets and continuous preferences. Then any consumer for whom $\exists x_i \in X_i: px_i < w_i$, ie some bundle cheaper than their budget set, is preference maximizing. If all consumers have some such $x_i$ then the WQE is a WE. 

Proof:
Fix $i$. Suppose WQE and the cheaper bundle but not maximizing. If so, there exists $x'$ such that $x' \succ x^*$ and $px' = w_i$. Let $x$ be a cheaper bundle. Define a sequence $\lambda_n$ such that $\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\lambda_n \to 1$. Then the convex combination  $x_n = \lambda_n x' + (1-\lambda_n) x$  has $px' < w_i$ for all $n$. But since $x' \succ x^*$ there is some ball of radius $r > 0$ around $x'$, with $x'' \in B \implies x'' \succ x^*$. But since $x_n \to x'$, there is some $N$ such that $n > N \implies x_n \in B$. So those $x_n$ are preferable to $x^*$ but cheaper - a contradiction of WQE condition.
