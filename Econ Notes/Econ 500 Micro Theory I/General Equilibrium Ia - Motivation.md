# [[General Equilibrium Ia - Motivation]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>

## General vs Partial Equilibrium

Previously we studied partial equilibrium. In this conception we studied the problem of an individual agent, and from that perspective we were able to exogenize several important things, most notably price. Now we are going to ask - what would happen if we try to endogenize price? Is a price not the result of endogeneous actions that determine supply and demand?

'Zooming out' to this level allows for broader conceptions of certain problems. 

## Illustrative Example

We're going to study a tax incidence case. Suppose we have $N$ towns with $N$ firms, and $M$ workers spread across these towns, with $N, M$ pretty big. The firms have a common technology $f(z)$, for labor $z$ with $f'>0$ and $f'' < 0$. The output is sold at price $1$. 

Now, what happens when a town (eg town 1) imposes some tax $t$ on its local firm?

### Partial Equilibrium

Let $w$ be the prevailing wage. Then, in the pretax case, the firm maximizes $f(z) -wz$, and from the FOC we have that $f'(z^*) = w$. Adding this up across firms, we have that $z_1 = z_
