## Live Notes

Production set common type: 
$y \in \R


Production set properties: 
- nonempty
- closed
- y \cap R_+ = {0} = no free lunch, possiblity of ination
- y \in Y, y' \leq y \implie y' \in Y (free displosal)

we also have convexity of the production set. 


popular, optional properties
- Returns to scale decreasing: $y \in y \implies \alpha y \in Y\; \forall \alpha\; \in [0,1]$
	- increasing $y \in y \implies \alpha y \in Y\; \forall \alpha\; \geq 1$
	- constant $y \in y \implies \alpha y \in Y\; \forall \alpha \geq 0$

These are also convex combinations? 

Convexity implies non-increasing returns to scale. Almost by definition. But converse does not hold. To see why, consider production set that's lower contour set of 
$$ F(x) = \begin{cases} \log(-x) & x \leq 0\end{cases}$$
but create a little bump in it. a small enough bump preserves decreasing returns but doesn't keep convexity. 


## Profit Maximization

Profit maximization: $\max_{y \in Y} py$. Let $\pi(p) = \max_{y \in Y} py$ - the maximized profit. Called the profit function. $y(p)$ is a supply curve, $\arg \max_{y \in Y} py$. 

Frequently you will know about outputs and inputs, so can write $p_q q - D_z z$ with $q \subseteq \delta(z)$. Rev - costs


- Function is continuous. But not on a compact set. So question is open. We can't just have the Weierstrass theorem
- Increasing returns: no maximum.
- Decreasing returns? Not necess maximum. Ex: one input one output $F(x) = -1/x$
