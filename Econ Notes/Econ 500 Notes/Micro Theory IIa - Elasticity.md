# [[Micro Theory IIa - Elasticity]]

## Elasticity Basics

In utility maximization and other calculus problems we'll have quantities like $\frac{\partial x_i(p,w)}{\partial p_k}$. This tells you: if the price of good $k$ increases a tiny amount, how much more good $x_i$ will you demand? For normalization reasons, we might want this in percentage terms: If the price of good $k$ increases by $q \%$, by what percentage will demand for $x_i$ increase? 

We can get this by turning our 'tiny amounts' into 'tiny percentages':
$$\epsilon_{ik} = \frac{\partial x_i(p,w)}{x_i(p,w)} \big/ \frac{\partial p_k}{p_k} = \frac{\partial x_i(p,w)}{\partial p_k} \cdot \frac{p_k}{x_i(p.w)}$$Observing that $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \log a(x) = a'(x)/a(x)$, we can transform this:

$$\epsilon_{ik} = \frac{\partial \log x_i(p,w)}{\partial \log p_k} $$
$\epsilon_{ik}$ is the price elasticity of good $i$ with respect to price $k$. If $i \neq k$, we can call this a cross-price elasticity of demand. 

## Elasticity of Substitution

Define the marginal rate of substitution as the number of units of $i$ required to compensate for a unit loss in good $k$. This is simply:

$$MRS_{ik} = \frac{MU_i}{MU_j}$$
the ratio of the marginal utilities of $i$ and $j$. We can think of this as the (negative) slope of the indifference curve. Thus, a concave indifference curve arises if $MU_i$ falls as $i$ rises, and/or $MU_J$ rises as $j$ falls (diminishing marginal utility); then as $j \to 0$, more and more of $i$ is required to substitute for $j$. 

Then we can define an Elasticity of Substitution. $\epsilon_{ik}$ represents, given some utility, 

$$\epsilon\inv_{ik} = \frac{}{} $$
