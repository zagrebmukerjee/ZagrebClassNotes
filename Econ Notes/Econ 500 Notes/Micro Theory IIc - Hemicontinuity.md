# [[Micro Theory IIc - Hemicontinuity]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>

We are concerned now with correspondences, which can map $x$ to some set of $y$s. Intuitively that corresponds to flat regions on indifference curves. 

## Upper Hemicontinuous
Suppose a correspondence $f: X \to Y$. Suppose $f(x) \subseteq$ some compact subset of $Y$. As a heuristic, I say that $f$ is hemicontinuous if the graph of $f$ is a closed set. That means:
- For any convergent sequence $x_n \in X: x_n \to x$, and 
- if there is $y_n \in f(x_n)$ that converges to $y$; then
- $y \in f(x)$. 

Intuitively, im
