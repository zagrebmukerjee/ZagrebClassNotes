# [[Game Theory 501 II - Dominance and Nash Equilibrium]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>

## Dominance

The concept of dominance is best understood in the normal form of a game. Colloquially, it's a strategy that's just always worse than some other choice. 

$\sigma_i$ is <font color=gree>strictly dominated</font> if $\exists \, \sigma'_i$ such that $\forall s_{-i}$, $u(\sigma_i, s_{-i}) < u(\sigma_i', s_{-i})$. 

Note here that it's sufficient to check pure strategies of other players: if $\sigma'$ dominates for pure strategies it will dominate also for mixtures (ie linear combinations of pure strategy outcomes).
