# [[Game Theory 501 Ia - Backward Induction]]

## Game of Nim

Play Nim as follows: 

There are three piles of matchsticks, with $n_i$ sticks in pile $i$. Each player in turn chooses a pile, and takes one or more. THe winner is the person who takes the last stick. 

For intuition: Suppose we have 2 piles of matchsticks with the same number of sticks. Then Player $2$ has to win: if Player $1$ takes $x$ matchsticks from pile $i$, Player $2$ can take $x$ from pile $j$. 

With 2 piles and a different number, Player $1$ can take enough from one pile to equalize them, and then they're in the equalized scenario but with the order reversed. 

For more advanced analysis the game can be represented as a matrix, with each row being the binary representation of the number of sticks in each pile. Example: the triple $(11,12,7)$ becomes the matrix 


$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

The game can be approached as follows: A position is *safe* if the sum of every column is even. Otherwise it is unsafe. 
The win state of $0$ is a safe position. So I want to be handed a position and then turn it safe. 

Not a tremendously interesting game - though the object of a reasonable amount of analysis - but serves as a good introduction to the intuition around backward induction. 


## Backward Induction

This game has a subgame for each non-terminal node, which makes it well suited for backwards induction. 


### Backwards Induction Process

For each subgame with depth $1$, replace the root with a terminal node, corresponding to the choice preferred by the player whose turn it is. Rinse and repeat. At most, this has $d$ steps where $d$ is the depth of the overall tree. 

It's empirically non-obvious that people actually use backwards induction. Example: game of Centipede. 

![[Game Theory 501 Ia - Backward Induction 2023-02-25 18.28.26.excalidraw|300]]

Two players alternate: continue or stop? At the last subgame, player $2$ will want to stop, for a payoff of $3$. But then Player $1$ has a choice of $2,0$ or (if she were to continue) letting Player $2$ stop. So she will stop also, and so on, and so forth: so the players will end up at the $0,0$ node instead of $2,2$ or $1,3$, both of which would be preferable. 

In practice though people frequently continue throughout the game. Puzzling, I suppose.
