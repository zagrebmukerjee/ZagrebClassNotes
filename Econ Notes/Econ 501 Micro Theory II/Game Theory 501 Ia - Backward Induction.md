```ad-example
title: Game of Nim

Play Nim as follows: 

There are three piles of matchsticks, with $n_i$ sticks in pile $i$. Each player in turn chooses a pile, and takes one or more. THe winner is the person who takes the last stick. 

For intuition: Suppose we have 2 piles of matchsticks with the same number of sticks. Then Player $2$ has to win: if Player $1$ takes $x$
