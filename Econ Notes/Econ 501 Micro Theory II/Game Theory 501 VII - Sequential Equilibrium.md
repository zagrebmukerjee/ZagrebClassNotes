Some problems arise with [[ðŸš§Game Theory 501 VI - Imperfect Information#Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium|Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium]] (ie. sequential rationality and Bayes' Rule). These problems motivate the development of a new solution concept, 'Sequential Equilibrium'. 


## Imperfection of Perfect Bayes

Consider the following game:

Recall that a PBE constitutes an <font color=gree>assessment</font>: a combination of $\sigma$, a strategy profile, and $\mu$, probability distributions over nodes in information sets representing the beliefs of players. These must mutually satisfy sequential rationality and Bayes' Rule. 

But as before we get into trouble
