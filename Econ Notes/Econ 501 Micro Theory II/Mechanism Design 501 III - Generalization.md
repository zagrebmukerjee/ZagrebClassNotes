# [[Mechanism Design 501 III - Generalization]]

<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>

## What is Mechanism Design?

Mechanism design is also called 'reverse game theory'. At its core, that's exactly what it is. If I want to get a certain outcome from some agents, what game should I make them play such that my desired outcome is its equilibrium outcome? For instance, in the screening problem of [[Mechanism Design 501 I - Motivation, Screening Problem]], I want to discriminate between consumers based on how much they want my product. But if I offer too good a deal to the less-desirous customer, I risk making that deal attractive to the more-desirous, and thus forgoing the potential consumer surplus I could extract from them (incentive-compatibility); if I make that deal too bad, I drive them away (individual rationality). These $IC$ and $IR$ constraints will recur as characterizing the balancing act faced by many mechanism designers. 

So far we have considered various mechanisms that sellers may use to generate and maximize revenue: the screening and auction problems, which also cover scenarios of monopolist pricing, scarce good assignment etc. But the problem generalizes in various ways.
