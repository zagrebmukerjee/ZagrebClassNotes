# [[Mechanism Design 501 V - Signaling]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>


## Setup

Problem: Worker has private type information. Chooses to send a signal or not. Prospective employer has preferences over type and offers a wage based on test outcome. Crucially the sending of the signal is easier for higher types. 

Worker payoff is $w - c(e, \theta)$ where $e$ is the signal decision. Assume $c(0, \theta) = 0$ for all $\theta$. $C_\theta, C_{\theta e} < 0$ and $C_{e} > 0$; type decreases cost and marginal cost of signal. 

For instance could have $\theta \in \Theta = \{ \theta_L, \theta_H\}$ and $0 < \theta_H < \theta_L$, with $Pr(\theta= \theta_H) = \lambda$ and $\lambda \in (0,1)$. 

Firm payoff is $-(\theta - w)^2$.
