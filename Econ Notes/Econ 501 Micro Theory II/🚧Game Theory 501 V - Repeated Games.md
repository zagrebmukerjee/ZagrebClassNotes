## Math Note

Recall the formula for sums of infinite series: 

$$ \sum_{i=1}^\infty Ar^i = \frac{A}{1-r}$$

So by convention let's multiply discounty payoffs that go forever with a factor $(1-\delta)$ as a normalization. If I multiply them all, that's fine. In other words, if I'm going to get payoff $x_1$ forever, my utility (neatly) is $x_1$.
