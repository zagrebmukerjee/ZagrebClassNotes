## Representing Uncertainty

### Incomplete Information

The representation of games with incomplete information can be challenging. Suppose the following transformation of the Battle of the Sexes: 

|     | P               | G     |
| --- | --------------- | ----- |
| P   | $2 + \theta_1, 1$ | $0,0$ |
| G   | $0,0$           | $1, 2 + \theta_2$      |


Here, instead of static preferences, we've said each player has some degree of preference for $P$ vs $G$ that's unknown to the other player. So in order to make a decision, Player $1$ needs to consider their own preference. But they also need to form some belief about Player 2's preference. For instance, if they know $\theta_1 = 1$ but believe $\theta_2 = 5$ then they will think it much more likely that Player $2$ will choose $G$.

But to turn this into a strategy, Player $1$ also needs to think about Player $2$'s expectations about Player $1$'s preference; even if $\theta_2 = 5$, if Player $2$ thinks $\theta_1 = 10$ then they will believe it more likely that Player $1$ will play $P$; by ignoring that possibility, Player $1$ would forgo a potential gain. 

But then Player $1$ needs to understand that Player $2$ understands the above; and so Player $2$ will incorporate some guess about Player $1$'s guess about Player $2$'s guess about Player $1$. We can very quickly enter some sort of problem of infinite regress.

### Imperfect Information

A framework to analyze such games was developed by Harsanyi (with no particular basis in fact, but an eye to tractability). One may suppose that the game has a specific type of incomplete information: Nature draws $\theta_1, \theta_2$ from a commonly known distribution. So players have *common priors* and then can anchor their guesses about others' strategies in those priors. 

Suppose $\theta_i$ is drawn from $\text{Unif}(0, \epsilon_i)$, and both players know that. Player $1$ doesn't know what Player $2$ will do, but knows that it will be increasing in $\theta_2$. Therefore, Player $2$'s choice can be represented as a cutoff: if $\theta_2 > c_2$, $s_2 = G$.  

Then we can reason about Player $1$'s choice by the same monotonicity logic, ie. finding $c_1$ such that $\theta_1 > c_1 \implies s_1 = P$. It follows that for $\theta_1 = c_1$, Player $1$ is indifferent between $P$ and $G$.

$$\begin{align}
E[u_1(P)] &= E[u_1(G)]\\
(2 + \theta_1) P( \theta_2 < c_2) &= (1)P(\theta_2 > c_2)\\
(2 + \theta_1) \frac{c_2}{\epsilon_2} &= 1 - \frac{c_2}{\epsilon_2}\\
(2 + \theta_1) c_2 &= \epsilon_2 - c_2\\
3c_2 + c_1c_2  &= \epsilon_2 \\
c_1(c_2) &= \epsilon_2/c_2 - 3\\
c_1^* &=  \epsilon_2/c_2(c_1^*) - 3\\
&=  \epsilon_2/(\epsilon_1/c_1 -3) - 3\\
c_1 + 3 &= \frac{\epsilon_2c_1}{\epsilon_1 -3c_1} \\
0&=(c_1 + 3)(\epsilon_1 - 3c_1) - \epsilon_2 c_1 \\
&=c_1 \epsilon_1  + 3\epsilon_1 - 3c_1^2 - 9c_1 - \epsilon_2 c_1 \\
&= -3c_1^2 + c_1(\epsilon_1 - \epsilon_2 - 9) + 3 \epsilon_1

\end{align}$$
