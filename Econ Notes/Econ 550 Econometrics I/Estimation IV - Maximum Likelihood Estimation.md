[[Econ 550 Index]]
A more mathematical treatment of [[2001.6 Likelihood Inference]].


## Basics

The MLE method requires picking a <font color=gree>parametric family</font> of distributions, $\mathcal F = \{f_Y(y; \theta):\theta \in \R^k\}$. In other words, same densities up to some parameter(s) $\theta$. For instance, $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ is a parametric family (with $\theta = [\mu, \sigma]$; members of this family are $N(0,1), N(12.2, 40)$ etc. 

We observe a <font color=gree>sample</font>,
