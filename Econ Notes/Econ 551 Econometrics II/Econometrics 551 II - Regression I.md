# [[Econometrics 551 II - Regression I]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>


Recall the definition of conditional expectation function from [[Econometrics 551 I - Conditional Expectation]] as an orthogonal projection: given $M$ the set of square integrable functions (functions with $\int |m(x)|^2 dx < \infty$), the CEF is 

$$ \min_{m \in M} E[(Y - m(X))^2]$$
or equivalently, $m$ such that 
$$E[(Y - m(X))g(X)] = 0$$ 
for any square-integrable $g(X)$. 

## Regression

Let $e = Y - m(X)$. Then $Y = m(X) + e$. $m$ is a 'mean regression function', and $e$ is 'regression error'. This is all by construction, having created $m$ by projecting $X$ onto $Y$. No structural interpretations, no causality yet. 

Alternatively, consider some function $Y = m(X) + e$. 
There are 3 equivalences: 
1) $E(e|X) = 0$ means that $m(X)$ is the conditional expectation function: We know $E(Y|X) = E(m(X) + e|X) = m(X)$
2) $E[Y|X] = m(X)$ means that $E[e|X] = 0$: $E(Y|X) = E(m(X) + e|X) = m(X) + E[e|X] = E[Y|X] + E[e|X]$. 
3) $E[eg(X)] = 0$ for all $g \in M$ means that $E(Y|X) = E(m(X) + e -
