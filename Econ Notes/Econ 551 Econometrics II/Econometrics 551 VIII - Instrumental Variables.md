# [[Econometrics 551 VIII - Instrumental Variables]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>

## Motivation

Instrumental variables are a very popular way to deal with endogeneity - when I think that my regressors are correlated with the (true) error term.

### Example: Wages and Schooling
Consider a common problem - that of omitted ability bias in determining the effect of schooling on wages. 

$$ Y = \ln w $$
$$ w = p_H \exp[\beta_1 S] \exp[\gamma A] \exp u $$
$$ Y = \ln p_H + \beta_1 S + \gamma A + u$$

Here $w$ is income, $p_H$ is price of human capital, $S$ is schooling, $A$ is ability, and $E[Su] = E[Au] = 0$.

"Economists doing semi-structural work will reverse engineer a model to correspond (in linearity) to the regression they're going to run." - Ed Vytlacil
```

I can write this also as $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 S_i + e_i$ where $e = (u - Eu) + \gamma(A - EA)$ - note I've separated $u$ and $\gamma A$ into average parts that will be in $\beta_0$ and individual variation which will be in my error term. But I have a problem: 

$$\begin{align}
E[eS] &= E[((u - Eu) + \gamma(A - EA))S] \\
&= E[Su] - E[S]E[u] + \gamma E[SA] - \gamma E[A]E[S] \\
&= \gamma \cov(A,S)\\
\end{align}$$So unless I think ability and schooling have nothing to do with each other - or ability has nothing to do with earnings - $\beta_1$ won't be the actual relationship I want (see [[Econometrics 551 II - Regression I#Omitted Variable Bias|Omitted Variable Bias]] for more detail). OLS will be inconsistent. 


### Schooling Instrument

```ad-important
title: Valid Instrument 


Suppose some variable $Z$ satisfies the following conditions: 

1) <font color=gree>Instrument Relevance</font>: $\cov(Z, S) \neq 0$ 
2) <font color=gree>Exogeneity</font>: $E[Ze] = 0$. 

Then $Z$ is a <font color=gree>valid instrument</font> for X.
```

Relevance is testable - simply look at it. But exogeneity is not. 

$$\begin{align}
E[Y - \beta_0 - \beta_1S] &= E[e] = 0 \text{ by construction } \\
E[ Z(Y - \beta_0 - \beta_1 S)] &= 0 \text{ exogeneity }\\
\end{align}$$ 
From the first expression we can remove $\beta_0$. 
$$\begin{align}
\beta_0 &= E[Y] - \beta_1 E[S]\\
0&= E[Z((Y - EY) - \beta_1(S - ES))] \\
0&= E[Z(Y - EY)] - \beta_1E[Z(S - ES)] \\
\beta_1 &= \frac{\cov(Z, Y)}{\cov(Z,S)}
\end{align}$$

Note the difference between this and an OLS on $Z$.
