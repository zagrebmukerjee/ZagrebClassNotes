# [[Econometrics 551 VIII - Instrumental Variables]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>

## Motivation

Instrumental variables are a very popular way to deal with endogeneity - when I think that my regressors are correlated with the (true) error term.

### Endogeneity: Wages and Schooling

Consider a common problem - that of omitted ability bias in determining the effect of schooling on wages. 

$$ Y = \ln w $$
$$ w = p_H \exp[\beta_1 S] \exp[\gamma A] \exp u $$
$$ Y = \ln p_H + \beta_1 S + \gamma A + u$$

Here $w$ is income, $p_H$ is price of human capital, $S$ is schooling, $A$ is ability, and $E[Su] = E[Au] = 0$.

"Economists doing semi-structural work will reverse engineer a model to correspond (in linearity) to the regression they're going to run." - Ed Vytlacil
```

I can write this also as $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 S_i + e_i$ where $e = (u - Eu) + \gamma(A - EA)$ - note I've separated $u$ and $\gamma A$ into average parts that will be in $\beta_0$ and individual variation which will be in my error term. But I have a problem. Suppose $S$ is independent of $u$.  

$$\begin{align}
E[eS] &= E[((u - Eu) + \gamma(A - EA))S] \\
&= E[Su] - E[S]E[u] + \gamma E[SA] - \gamma E[A]E[S] \\
&= \gamma \cov(A,S)\\
\end{align}$$So unless I think ability and schooling have nothing to do with each other - or ability has nothing to do with earnings - $\beta_1$ won't be the actual relationship I want (see [[Econometrics 551 II - Regression I#Omitted Variable Bias|Omitted Variable Bias]] for more detail). OLS will be inconsistent. 


### Schooling Instrument

```ad-important
title: Definition: Valid Instrument (1)


Suppose, in the schooling case, that some variable $Z$ satisfies the following conditions: 

1) <font color=gree>Instrument Relevance</font>: $\cov(Z, S) \neq 0$ 
2) <font color=gree>Exogeneity</font>: $E[Ze] = 0$. 

Then $Z$ is a <font color=gree>valid instrument</font> for X.
```

Relevance is testable - simply look at it. But exogeneity is not. 

$$\begin{align}
E[Y - \beta_0 - \beta_1S] &= E[e] = 0 \text{ by construction } \\
E[ Z(Y - \beta_0 - \beta_1 S)] &= 0 \text{ exogeneity }\\
\end{align}$$ 
From the first expression we can remove $\beta_0$. 
$$\begin{align}
\beta_0 &= E[Y] - \beta_1 E[S]\\
0&= E[Z((Y - EY) - \beta_1(S - ES))] \\
0&= E[Z(Y - EY)] - \beta_1E[Z(S - ES)] \\
\beta_1 &= \frac{\cov(Z, Y)}{\cov(Z,S)}
\end{align}$$

Note the difference between this and an OLS on $Z$. 

### Simultaneity
Another use case - we can think of this as a form of exogeneity, but it has its own rich history as a problem. 

A market has the following demand and supply schedules, as functions of clearing price $\tilde P$:

$$ Q^d = \beta_0^d + \beta_1^d \widetilde P + e^d $$
$$ Q^s = \beta_0^s + \beta_1^s \widetilde P + e^s $$
where $E[e^s] = E[e^d] = E[e^se^d] = 0$. $P$ and $Q$ are observable, with $Q = Q^s(P) = Q^d(P)$ - the market clears. This gives us an expression for that price: 

$$\begin{align}
Q^d(P) &= Q^s(P)\\
\beta_0^d + \beta_1^d P + e^d &=  \beta_0^s + \beta_1^s  P + e^s \\
(\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s)P &= \beta_0^s - \beta_0^d + e^s - e^d\\
P &= \frac{\beta_0^s - \beta_0^d + e^s - e^d}{\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s}
\end{align}$$
So: 
$$\begin{align}
E[Pe^s] &= E\left[\frac{\beta_0^s - \beta_0^d + e^s - e^d}{\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s}e_s\right]\\
&= \frac{1}{\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s}\left(E\left[(e^s)^2] - E[e^d e^s\right] + (\beta_0^s - \beta_0^d\right)E[e^s])\\
&= \frac{E[(e^s)^2]}{\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s}\\
&= \frac{\var(e^s)}{\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s}\\
E[Pe^d] &= \frac{\var(e^d)}{\beta_1^s - \beta_1^d}
\end{align}$$

#### Instrument Approach

Suppose an instrument $Z$ that moves supply but not demand. I can use this as a lever for the estimation of the $\beta$ parameters. (What would such a thing look like? Whether I have one or not needs to be based on a 'story'). 

So 

$$ Q^s = \beta_0^s + \beta_1^s P + \beta_2^s Z+  e^s$$ with $E[e^sZ] = E[e^dZ] = 0$. 
Then 
$$ P = \frac{\beta_0^s - \beta_0^d + \beta_2^sZ + e^s - e^d }{\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s}$$

In other words, price is linear in $Z$: 

$$\cov(P,Z) = \frac{\beta_2^s}{\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s}$$
assuming $\beta_2^S$ nonzero. 

Since $\cov(Q, Z) = \beta_1^d \cov(P,Z)$, that lets us back out $\beta_1^d$:

$$\beta_1^d = \frac{\cov(Q, Z)}{\cov(P,Z)}$$

$$\begin{align}
E[Ze^d] &=\frac{1}{\beta_2^s} E[e^d\left((\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s)P -  (\beta_0^s - \beta_0^d + e^s -e^d)\right)]\\
& =\frac{\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s}{\beta_2^s} E[e^dP]+  \frac{1}{\beta_2^s}E[e^d(\beta_0^d - \beta_0^s + e^d -e^s)]\\
& =\cov(P,Z)\inv \var(e^d)  + \frac{\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s}{\beta_2^s}E[e^d(\beta_0^d - \beta_0^s) + e^d(e^d -e^s)]\\
&= \cov(P,Z)\inv + (\beta_1^d - \beta_1^s)/\beta_2^s
\end{align}$$

## Instrumental Variables


Suppose $Y_i = X_i' \beta + e_i$; let $\underset{K + 1 \times 1}{X_i} = [\underset{K_1 + 1\times 1}{X_{1i}}' \; \underset{K_2 \times 1}{X_{2i}} ']'$, and $\underset{K + 1 \times 1}{\beta} = [\beta_1 \; \beta_2]'$, so we can write $Y_i = X_{1i}'\beta_1+ X_{2i}\beta_2 + e_i$. We have $X_{1i}$ exogenous, so $E[X_{1i}e_i] = 0$, but $X_{2i}$ endogenous, so $E[X_{2i}e_i] \neq 0$. 


```ad-important 
title: Definition: Valid IV (2)
Then $\underset{L \times 1}{Z_i}$ (with no perfect collinearity) is a <font color=gree>valid instrumental variable</font> for $X_i$ if:
1) $E[Z_ie_i] = 0$ and 
2) $E[Z_iX_i']$ is full rank , ie. rank $K+1$. 
```


By pre-multiplying both sides of the structural model  by $Z_i$ we can find a system of equations:

$$\underset{L \times 1}{E[Z_i Y_i]} = \underset{L \times K + 1}{ E[Z_i X_i']}\underset{K + 1 \times 1} \beta$$
The full rank condition means that this system has a unique solution $\beta$. If $L = K$ we say 'exactly identified', and if $L > K$ we call it "overidentified". 

Typically we'll take $Z_i = [X_{1i}' \; \underset{L_2 \times 1}{Z_{2i}}]'$, i.e. instrument for the exogenous regressors with themselves (some skip this step altogether). In that framework you can talk about $X_{1i}$ as 'included exogenous variables' and $X_{2i}$ as 'excluded exogenous variables'. Assume $L_2 > K_2$. 

Then we can expand the model: 

$$ Y_i = X_i'\beta + e_i; \; \; X_i = \Pi' Z_i + u_i$$

The latter is a linear projection. So by definition, $\Pi'Z_i = \mathbf L(X_i |Z_i)$ and $E[ u_iZ_i ] = 0$, and $\Pi = E[Z_iZ_i']\inv E[Z_iX_i']$. 

### First Stage

The second equation is the 'first stage' or a 'reduced form' for $X$. Given our stipulation that $Z_{1i} = X_{1i}$ we can rewrite 

$$ \Pi = \begin{bmatrix} \underset{K_1 + 1 \times K_1 + 1 + 1} I & \underset{K_2 }{\Pi_{12}} \\ 0 & \underset{}{\Pi_{22}}\end{bmatrix}$$
which implies that 
$$ \begin{bmatrix} X_{1i}\\X_{2i} \end{bmatrix} = \Pi'Z_i + u_i = \begin{bmatrix}  I & 0 \\ \underset{}{\Pi_{12}} & \underset{}{\Pi_{22}}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} Z_{1i}\\Z_{2i}\end{bmatrix}+ u_i  = \begin{bmatrix} 
X_{1i}\\
\Pi_{12} X_{1i} + \Pi_{22} Z_{2i} 
\end{bmatrix} +  \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ u_{2i} \end{bmatrix}$$
or 
$$\begin{align}X_{1i} &= Z_{1i}\\
X_{2i} &= \Pi_{12}X_{1i} + \Pi_{22}Z_{2i} + u_{2i}\\
\end{align}$$

Here we're writing $u_{2i}$ to remind us where that error term is coming from. 

### Identification

We know that $\Pi = E[Z_iZ_i']\inv E[Z_iX_i']$, so $E[Z_iX_i'] = E[Z_iZ_i']\Pi$. This means that $E[Z_iX_i]$ is full rank if and only if $\Pi$ is full rank. So instrument exogeneity implies that $\Pi' E[Z_i X_i'] = \Pi' E[Z_i Z_i'] \Pi$ is invertible. 

Then: 

$$\begin{align}
Y_i &= X_i' \beta + e\\
Z_iY_i &= Z_iX_i'\beta + Z_i e\\
\Pi'E[Z_i Y_i] &= \Pi'E[Z_iX_i']\beta\\
\beta &= (\Pi'E[Z_iX_i']\inv E[Z_iY_i]\\
	&= (E[Z_iZ_i']\Pi)
\end{align}$$
