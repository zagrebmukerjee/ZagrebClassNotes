Conditional Expectation
- CE as an orthogonal projection

BLP formula: $X'X\inv$ $X'Y$
- BLP vs CEF: $E[e|X] = 0$; required for BLP = CEF. $E[eX] = 0$ follows from BLP construction.
- Regression derivatives

PS1 Q1 result: $E[Y|X, f(X)] = E[Y|X]$ 

Reparametrization
- Any full-rank (invertible) transformation of covariates is same projection
- Turn $X$ into $X- \mu$ 

Measurement Error
- classical measurement error 

Law of Iterated Expectations, how to use it in problems
- example: PS2, Q4: missing at random creates unbiased if $E[e|X]=0$. See: aronow and miller 
- example: PS3, Heckman Selection
- example: PS3, propensity score theorem

FWL theorem/partialling out/iterated projection


Convergence in probability; properties

Convergence in distribution; properties
- especially if $C_n \to_p c$ and $Y_n \to_d Y$ then $C_n Y_n \to_d cY$.
