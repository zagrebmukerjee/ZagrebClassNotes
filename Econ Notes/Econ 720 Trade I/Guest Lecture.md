what makes a top paper
-great model
-amazing data
-very creative (imperative for econ JMP)

talk about 2 and 3: how to get an idea, get data, circle back from data to idea
yale emphasizes 1 a lot
a lot of good empirical trade people here too: amit, pete. reduced form is fine to do



Paper
- what determines attitudes towards trade. Do fundamentals matter. 
- how does a firm's dependence on intl trade shape attitudes towards openness of employees
- what trade policy creates welfare benefits adn popular support


setting 2007 costa rica. first natl referendum on trade in Costa Rica
CAFTA: US CR bilateral. US is 45% of CR trade; 59% turn out; 51.2% in favor of trade


she was in costa rica and is from there. JMP was on CR. wanted to keep working there. Asked parents what's going on that is weird? then settled on this referendum
realized that a lot of data was available, super granular on voters
Her comparative advantage was local knowledge of Costa Rica

Peru also has great voting data


why might individual care about FTA: some discussion of real incomes; lower prices; noneconomic factors. want to get at all of them

### Voting Mechanics

people are assigned a school to vote based on geography, a classroom alphabetically. 1 classroom/voting board has about 500 on average. 
For each: list of !Ds assigned to voting board; referendum outcomes
Decisions FTA Y/N
59% of 18+ voted

link IDs to employer-employee data but only 42% match. many male-breadwinner HHs. how to capture their exposure? Happened to know that PLSC folks in PR had used marriage records so she knew the merge was possible, went to National Registry to get it

after that 62% of voters mapped to firm
NOTE: this paper WAS published in a great journal (review of economic studies) despite that
The authors framed the 62% as - this is huge, way beyond what anyone has, given the secret ballot! 
	- qs: selection into electorate/missingness; ecological inf at classroom levels

Then: rely on Helpman Itskhoki Muendler Redding 2016 on estimating wage bill change from tariffs
- for firm i product j can compute exposure 
	- merge imports data to firm data. tons of imports didn't merge what. realized this is imports by individuals (eg purchase from Amazon) - a cool paper in itself. 
	- France also has individual imports data of this sort. US is in bills of lading (expensive)
- Changes in tariffs are from MFN tozero. sort of like an exo shift. 

Also compute indirect exposures: how many degrees are you away from trade shock, look at buyers/sellers who trade; in the lit

Then a result: firm exposure to trade -> big boost in probability of vote (3.4%)
Indirect exposure also big effect, 2/3 of direct

a concern, worker select themselves into firms
"the identification police, they are always going to have concerns"
not a dealbreaker, usually a way to convince people that the concern is surmountable. Build the case
- eg indirect exports was a big concern for identification! Soln: model the spillovers

### Mechanisms
poeple seeemed very informed about the FTA. (from a survey)
'when you're doing a seminar, an anecdote never hurts': public broadcast of the FTA debate was more watched than anything else besides when CR opened world cup against DE



Explore role of political views: there was a pres election result year before. classroom changes were v small. So controlled for pro FTA political candidate (proxy of pol affiliation). If it survives, really good test


expenditures channel
get cons bundle imputed for HH based on income, occ, etc
heroically assume price delta for the basket based on some ideas in the lit

not ideal but impossible to speak to otherwise. 


## Second paper

online shopping woohoo. 1/3 ppl is online shopper. Breaks link between geo and cons bundle/varieties available

something about peer effects: impact of online shopping adoption on indiv networks, firm behvr
'internet penetration' instrument not good enough any more

Instrument. link costa rican migrants in US cities to relatives in costa rica, merging voter data from consulates (mandatory voting) with data on family links. 

If product becomes popular in US City A. then look at the relatives of the X country migrants in City A. An exogenous shock to demand for this product on those social networks in X country. Do local retailers respond
- seems yes. is the mechanism product discovery, or new info about/creation of demand

Crucially from customs one has data on _individual_ level 'imports' ie online purchases 
domestic networks from a venmo equivalent to get at friends network. family is known. coworkers also. 

and we have retailers frm tax data


yale has nielsen data which has BARCODE level data on consumption (locationally?) a lot of this is from supermarkets.
<font color=#F7B801> can I use this to get location level data on gains from trade OR on pricing </font>
<font color=#F7B801> amazon primed question - individual level online shopping? Problem, no variations</font>

cons expenditure quarterly by MSA, bridge: fruman et al 17, hottman monarch 20' HS4/HS6 level
imports: monthly by customs districts, 20K product codes, 2015-19 - Most variation at HS6/10. Acosta cox 23. Peter schott has this data
validate with US custom districts data, debit card transactions data


Melissa Dell has a cool paper on trade induced violence
also a cool test. take ur observed whatever and see vs. placebo randomization of shifts and/or shares.
