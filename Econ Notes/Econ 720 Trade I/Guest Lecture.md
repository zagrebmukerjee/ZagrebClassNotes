setting 2007 costa rica. first natl referendum on trade in Costa Rica
CAFTA: US CR bilateral. US is 45% of CR trade; 59% turn out; 51.2% in favor of trade


she was in costa rica and is from there. JMP was on CR. wanted to keep working there. Asked parents what's going on that is weird? then settled on this referendum
realized that a lot of data was available, super granular on voters
Her comparative advantage was local knowledge of Costa Rica

Peru also has great voting data


why might individual care about FTA: some discussion of real incomes; lower prices; noneconomic factors. want to get at all of them
