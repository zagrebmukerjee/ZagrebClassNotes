Paper. Just looking at the model, really get into it
notation is a big part of the cost

three components, building from the bottom


when you write a model. look at other models but build your own. when people (esp PhD students) take one off the shelf, it inevitably feels forced
Two cultural traits ${a,b}$
Equally sized populations of adult males, females.
2 period lifespan - regular, parent
1 family -> 1 boy 1 girl child. so demographics stationary


Kid is born as cultural naif/blank state
if parents are homogamous - same group - parents choose effort to socialize the kid first. Vertical socialization. 
They'll solve that, then solve the marriage market 

>write a nice model and then go to the data. that's not what we do! This isn't physics. 

child inherits trait with probability that's increasing in effort $\tau^a$ or $\tau^b$. If not, is still naif -> gets $i$ with probability $q^i$, pop share of $i$. 
Cost $H(\tau^i)$ increasig and convex, $H(0) = 0$. Effort choice. 

So parents do a backward induction type: depending on what happens. <font color=#F7B801>immediate conclusion is that minorities try super hard to socialize their child. But then what are the dynamics</font>

Let $V_{ij}$ be parent utility from child $i$
