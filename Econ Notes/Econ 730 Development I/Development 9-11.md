Theme for the day: inefficient allocation of labor. There is a large wage gap between urban and rural in India: large in absolute terms (30 percent higher in city after adjusting for CoL and unemployment risk), large relative to other countries, large relative to other developing countries. Urbanization in India remains very low (20%, vs 60% for China). Why?

Proposed answer is that extant risk-sharing networks inhibit it. Specifically, subcastes - tight-knit social groups with dense kinship ties - provide a method of risk sharing that relies on low migration rates. The castes effectively collect taxes or insurance premia to provide consumption smoothing across members. Caste organization is well-poised to do so because these dense ties allow for observability - are you actually badly off, do you need insurance? and enforcement - pay up or we will shun you, and other castes will categorically not accept you. Migration ruins this cozy setup. Cuts workers off from observability, enforcement; produces alternative income sources. 
- Effectively, the wage gap reflects greater ability of rurals to consumption smooth

Descriptive analysis of credit suggestive: loans from community/caste members tend to have lower collateral requirements, interest rates; make up large proportion of loans. 

Test this hypothesis by examining which members ex ante have less to gain from insurance networks. These people should migrate more. And we do see that - higher rates of migration from wealthier households, less from households facing greater income risk


The papers presented highlight two important datasets - ICRISAT, a detailed examination of several villages that has data on innumerable characteristics (demographics, crop choice, income), and ARIS-REDS, a longer term (1968-2008) collection of farm management, demographics, fertility, education panel
