Ton of papers on trade policy impacts. Barrier to entry to write a model or do an analysis - very low. 



effects of trade policy across space. lot of empirical studies; find trade policy has heterogenous spatial effects.
combo of fixed and mobile factors (labor); gravity distribution of labor arising from heterogenous factor
can add trade imbalances ('global portfolio' model)


world input output database
- "this is real data"
GTAP data set 141 countries 65 sectors, very disaggregated- they bought
Commodity flwos survey
tariff WITS data


methods forcounterfactuals: exact hat, dynamic hat.

world IO data base is country to country transactions across sectors
- not regional though. that  would be the next step...
- CFS is mroe regional for US
- something he said about NUTS2 level

people look at extensive margin of trade and how it changes: new products old products. econ department PhD student Lorenzo



Add fixed cost of entry into exporting. barrier for new exporters
firm problems should I export
some IO type work


### Discussion

overall: big step forward in quant frameworks, methosd, data -> unedrstand mechanisms and GE effects; understand disaggregate distributional effects
Progress needed on developing tools to perform model evaluation applied to trade analysis to assess counterfactual predictions


### New idea

when might tthere be nonzero optimal tariff - market power exists at thecountry level. firms cannot exploit - competitive amongst themselves - tariffs let the govt seize that for the people



fun paper Everett 1963 - "Generalized Lagrange Multiplier Method for Solving Problems of Optimum Allocation of Resources"?
