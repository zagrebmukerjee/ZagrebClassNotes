## [[ðŸ“¦ Kalecki Profits Model]]

The workers in a closed economy earn total wages $W$. Capitalists earn no wage, but make profits $P$. The firms' revenues are split into profits and wages. The workers and capitalists consume: $C_w$ and $C_c$. The capitalists can also invest $I$. 

The total expenditure in the economy is equal to the total revenue. This lets us have the following identity:

$$ \overbrace{P + W}^{\text{Total Revenue}} = \overbrace{C_w + C_c + I}^{\text{Total Expenditure}} $$

From the identity $W = C_w$ we can get that 

$$ P = C_c + I$$

Thus the rate of profit is the sum of capitalist consumption and investment - the famous Kalecki equation. 

Put another way, worker consumption and income is on both sides of the revenue ledger and cancels itself out. If capitalists neither consume nor invest, the rate of profit will fall.
