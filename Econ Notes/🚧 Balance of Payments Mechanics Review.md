### [[ðŸš§ Balance of Payments Mechanics Review]]
Part of [[@Bridgewater Concepts Index]]

### What is the Balance of Payments?

#### Current Account, Capital Account

Suppose there are countries A and B. People from A want to buy goods and assets from Country B. To do so, they need to purchase B's currency. So they exchange Currency A for Currency B. The reverse happens for people from Country B. 

From the perspective of Country A, the goods that citizens from A want to buy from B are imports. The goods that citizens from B want to buy from A are exports. 

The net flow of goods and services into or out of A (exports - imports) is called the <font color="gree">current account </font>. The flow of assets is called the <font color="gree">capital account</font>. They can be denominated in either currency, or a different currency altogether.

If the current account is in deficit, that means a country is importing more than it exports. 

The current account and capital account always sum to zero (plus reserve accumulation - more on that below). Why? Because the currency market has to clear.

#### Currency Market

Currency markets are where the citizens of A and B get each others' currencies. They differ from other markets. In a regular market, some people supply a good/service/asset; others demand it. They give money to the suppliers in exchange for the supplied thing; the balance of supply and demand determines the price in money. 

In the currency markets, there is no money. Both sides simultaneously supply and demand - citizens of A supply A's currency and demand B's, and vice versa. There is also no price - there is only the relative value of currencies, the <font color="gree">exchange rate </font> (e.g. one USD buys you .8 EUR or such). However, the same sort of Marshallian process takes place.

The market always clears. This means that - in terms of either currency - the total supplied and the total demanded are the same, since each transaction has two sides.

If the demand curve for A were to move right (more demand) - then more of currency B would have to be offered for each unit of A. Thus, appreciation. 

This is why the current account and capital account always sum to zero. Together, they represent the net purchases of goods and services in the last period. Since the market has to clear, this total has to be zero - the currency "price" adjusts so that this is true. 

#### Real exchange rate concepts

Underyling this movement of currency back and forth is, of course, a flow of real goods, services, and assets. If you take out the money abstraction,

#### Reserves and BoP interventions




#### BoP Adjustments

Suppose countries A and B trade goods; and suppose demand for A's goods suddenly increases relative to B's. In the short term, what happens?

Citizens of B take Currency B, exchange it for Currency A, and buy goods from A; and citizens of A stop buying goods from B, hence stop buying currency B, and spend more domestically. 

This results in pressure on Currency A to appreciate since more people are buying it. It also results in [[ðŸš§ Kalecki Profits Model|inflationary pressure]]in A's goods, since more of A and B's citizens are now trying to buy the same amount of goods. 

Simultaneously, demand for B's goods has fallen, resulting in  pressures towards unemployment, a wider output gap, and deflation. 

There are a few paths to equilibrium. 
- Country A can allow the inflation or appreciation
