## [[ðŸš§ Inflation 101]]


Basic concept of inflation: "too much money going after too few goods and services", which results in price increases. 


### Basic model

This is a good start but obscures many important dynamics. Let's create a series of simple models to explain it. 

We'll start with Michal Kalecki's profit equation. The  workers in a closed economy earn total wages $W$. Capitalists earn no wage, but make profits $P$. The firms' revenues are split into profits and wages. The workers and capitalists consume: $C_w$ and $C_c$. The capitalists can also invest $I$. 

The total expenditure in the economy is equal to the total revenue. This lets us have the following identity:

$$ \overbrace{P + W}^{\text{Total Revenue}} = \overbrace{C_w + C_c + I}^{\text{Total Expenditure}} $$

From the identity $W = C_w$ we can get that 

$$ P = C_c + I$$

Thus the rate of profit is the sum of capitalist consumption and investment - the famous Kalecki equation.
