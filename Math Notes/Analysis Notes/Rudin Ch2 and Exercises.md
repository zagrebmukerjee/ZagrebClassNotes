## Notes

Metric space = a set + a distance fn
Distance properties:
1) non-negativity (positivity if $p /neq q$
2) symmetry
3) triangle inequality 


open balls - one of which is a neighborhood - can write $N_r(x)$ is $\{ p | d(p,x)<r \}$ (note - strictly less than. if $\leq$ then closed ball)


- Limit point: $p$ is limit pt of set $E$ if *every* neighborhood of $p$ contains some $q$ such that $q \neq p$ and $q \in E$.
- Isolated point: $p \in E$ but $p$ is not a limit point
- Interior point: $p \in E$ and  there exists a ball $N_r(p)$ that is a subset of $E$. 

- Set is open if every point is an interior point. Intuitively that means you can sort of jiggle anything around and it'll remain in the set.
- Closed set
