## Notes

Metric space = a set + a distance fn
Distance properties:
1) non-negativity (positivity if $p /neq q$
2) symmetry
3) triangle inequality 


open balls - one of which is a neighborhood - can write $N_r(x)$ is $\{ p | d(p,x)<r \}$ (note - strictly less than. if $\leq$ then closed ball)


- Limit point: $p$ is limit pt of set $E$ if *every* neighborhood of $p$ contains some $q$ such that $q \neq p$ and $q \in E$.
- Isolated point: $p \in E$ but $p$ is not a limit point
- Interior point: $p \in E$ and  there exists a ball $N_r(p)$ that is a subset of $E$. 

- Set is open if every point is an interior point. Intuitively that means you can sort of jiggle anything around and it'll remain in the set.
- Closed set

Every algebraic number can be written as $n+1$ integers $(a_0, \ldots, a_n)$. We know from the hint that there is a finite number of these for every integer; it follows that there's a finite number for each length $n$, since no finite set has infinite subsets. So we have a finite number of finite sets. A parallel argument to the $\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z^n$ thence applies.

Consider the progression of intervals $(1/n, 1)$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. 
- This covers $(0,1$): Suppose $0 \leq x \leq 1$. There is an integer $m$ such that $m > 1/x$. It follows that $1/m < x$; thus, $x \in (1/m, 1)$. 
- This has no finite subcover: Suppose there is a finite subcover. Then that subcover has a least element, $1/n_{min}$. But we know that  $1/(n_{min} + 1) >0$; and $1/(n_{min} + 1) < 1/n_{min}$, so $1/(n_{min} + 1) \notin (1/n_{min}, 1)$. Thus the finite subcover is not a cover.
