a) Suppose $r + x = q$ is rational. We write that $x = q - r$. But since the rationals are closed under addition, this would mean that $x$ is rational - a contradiction. 
b) Suppose $rx = q$ is rational. Then $r\inv q = x$.   But since the rationals are closed under multiplication, this would mean that $x$ is rational - a contradiction.

Suppose that $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $q^2 = 12$. Let $q = m/n$ with $m$ even and $n$ odd, or vice versa; Then $12 = m^2/n^2$; $12 n^2 = m^2$. $n^2$ is odd, since $n$ is;
