1) ![[Pasted image 20220601195746.png]]

a) Suppose $r + x = q$ is rational. We write that $x = q - r$. But since the rationals are closed under addition, this would mean that $x$ is rational - a contradiction. 
b) Suppose $rx = q$ is rational. Then $r\inv q = x$.   But since the rationals are closed under multiplication, this would mean that $x$ is rational - a contradiction. 

2) ![[Pasted image 20220601200454.png]]

Suppose that $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $q^2 = 12$. Let $q = m/n$ with $m$ even and $n$ odd, or vice versa; Then $12 = m^2/n^2$; $12 n^2 = m^2$. Thus $m^2$ is even. Dividing by $4$ we find that $m^2/4 = 3n^2$; LHS is still even, RHS thus implies $n^2$ even, so a contradiction. 

3) prove 1.15:

a) Multiply: $ x\inv x y = y$. Since $xy = xz$ then $x\inv xz = y$, but $x\inv x z = 1z = z$ so we have $y = z$
b) From above we have $xy = xz \to y = z$. Let $z = 1$; then $xy = x$ implies $y = 1$. 
c) $xy = 1$ means that $x\inv \cdot 1 = x\inv xy$, and from a) we have that  $x\inv$.
d) We know that $x\inv x = 1$. Then multiply by $
