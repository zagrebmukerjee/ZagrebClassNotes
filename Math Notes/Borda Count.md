# [[Borda Count]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>



A [[Voting Rule]] that is non-dictatorial and Paretian but does not satisfy IIA. Used in major league baseball Hall of Fame rankings. Ask people for an ordered list of preferences. Each candidate gets $0$ points for each voter who listed them in first place, $1$ for second place and so on. The lowest score wins. 

## Properties

### Non-Dictatorial

Different preference orderings create different Borda scores. 

### Paretian

The Borda count is Paretian - if everyone prefers $x$ to $y$, $x$ will have a strictly lower score. 

### Transitive
