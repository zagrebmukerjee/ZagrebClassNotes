# [[Derivative Rules]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>



Various shorthands for computing the derivatives of combinations of differentiable functions. For geometric intuition see [[Video 4 Visualizing the Chain Rule and Product Rule]].

## Derivative of a Power

$$\frac{d}{dx} x^a = ax^{a-1}$$


### Proof

## Derivative of an Exponential

$$ \frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x $$
### Proof

From the definition of the derivative: 
$$\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx} e^x &= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{e^{x + t} - e^x}{t}\\
&= e^x\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{(e^t-1)}{t}\\
&= e^x \ln(x)
\end{align}$$
## Derivative of a Product

$$ \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)$$
### Proof

## Derivative of a Quotient

### Proof

A variety of proofs. Easiest one is by application of the Product Rule and Power Rule: 


## Derivative of Inverse Functions

## Derivative of Compositions

$$f(g(x)) = g'(x)f'(g(x))$$
