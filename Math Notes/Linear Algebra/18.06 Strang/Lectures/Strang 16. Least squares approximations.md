woohoo it is here

## Properties of Projection

Reiteration of projection: 
Projection matrix: $A(A'A)\inv A$
If $b$ is in the column space of $A$ then $Pb = b$, and therefore $P = I$. If $b \perp C(A)$ then $Pb = 0$.: 
$b \perp C(A) \to b \in N(A')$, so $(A'A)\inv A'b$ = (A'A)\inv (0) = 0$. 

Column space is $Ax$ for some $x$. So if $b \in C(A)$ then $Pb = A(A'A)A' b = A(A'A)\inv A' (Ax)$ = $A [ (A'A) \inv A'A)] x = Ax = b$. 


We can also think of this as a decomposition of $b$ into $p + e$. This makes it clear that $e$ is also a projection, in this case onto the left nullspace of $A$. This projection matrix is simply $I - P$ <font color=#F7B801>which we call the annihilator matrix.</font>

## Least Squares
find the best line thru some points. This is a system of linear equations, generally with no solutions. 

Ex: points are $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,2)$. Then the system of equations is 
$$\begin{align}
C + D &=1 \\
C + 2D &= 2 \\
C + 3D &= 2 \\
\end{align}$$
The lack of solution is apparent. 
In matrix notation: 
$$ Ax = b  \to \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 3\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} C\\D\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\3\end{bmatrix}$$
