# [[Strang 9. Independence, Basis, Dimension]]

## Callback
Look at $Ax = 0$, where  $A$ is $m \times n$ and $m < n$. More unknowns than equations. So there must be nonzero members of the null space, since there are only $n$ pivots at most - there will be free variables. 

## Independence
Vectors $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ are (linearly) independent if no combination of them gives the zero vector (save for all coefficients = 0). 

Note: $0$ and $x$ are always dependent
$2$ vectors in $\R^2$ are independent iff they are not parallel
