## Practice 5

a) 
$$P = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix} \to P^2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} \to P^3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} $$
b)
$$\widehat P = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\end{bmatrix} \to \widehat P^2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\end{bmatrix} \to \widehat P^4 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\end{bmatrix}$$

a) Each nonzero element in a $4\times4$ upper-triangular matrix: $4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10$. 
b) In this case, only $6$. Each $A_{ij}$ must be $-A_{ji}$, but when $i=j$, $A_{ii}$ must be $0$

a) If $A' = A$, and $B' = B$,  is $cA' + dB'$ symmetric? We know that $cA' = cA$, and $dB' = dB$, so each term is symmetric. And we know that $(A + B)' = A' + B' = A + B$. So this is a subspace.
b) If $A' = -A$, and $B' = -B$,  is $cA' + dB'$ skew-symmetric? We know that $cA' = -cA$, and $dB' = -dB$, so each term is skew-symmetric. $(A + B)' = A' + B' = -A + -B = -(A + B)$. So it is a subspace. 
c) No. The origin must be in every subspace. 


## Practice 6

a) Suppose $x = s_1 + t_1$ and $y = s_2 + t_2$. Then are $cx$ and $x + y$ in $S+ T$? $cx = cs_1 + ct_1$. Since $cs_1 \in S$ and $ct_1 \in T$, $cx \in S + T$. $x + y = s_1 + s_2 + t_1 + t_2$. Since $s_1 + s_2 \in S$, and $t_1 + t_2 \in T$, $x + y \in S + T$. 

b) $S + T$ is the unique plane that contains $S$ and $T$. Consider for simplicity  $S = x_i$ and $T = x_j$ axes in $\R^m$ (which we can rotate for generality). $S \cup T$ is the set of vectors defined as   $$\{x_1, \ldots, x_m |x_p = 0 \iff p \neq  j\} \cap \{x_1, \ldots, x_m |x_p = 0 \iff p \neq  i\}$$These are the points on either axis. $S + T$ is all linear combinations of these vectors, which can give all vectors $\{(x_1, \ldots, x_m |x_p = 0 \iff p \neq (i \lor j)\}$. This is the $x_i, x_j$ plane in $\R^m$, and the span of $S \cup T$ (the set of linear combinations of vectors in $S + T$).

Other points on the plane: (13,0,1); (16,1,1).
We can write $x = 3y + z + 12$. So we can say the blanks are $12,3,1$.

$N(A)$ is the set of $x$ such that $Ax = 0$. $Cx = \begin{bmatrix} Ax \\ Bx \end{bmatrix}$. So the null space of $C$ is $N(A) \cup N(B)$. 
## Recitation 7
The set of points such that $x - 5y + 2z = 9$ is a ___ in $\R^3$. It is ___ to the ___ $S_0$ which satisfies $x -5y + 2z = 0$. 

All points of $S$ have a specific form, 
$$\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \_ \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}  + c_1\begin{bmatrix} \_ \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}  + c_2\begin{bmatrix} \_ \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$

This set of points is a plane, since it has $1$ equation and $3$ unknowns - rank $1$. It is parallel to the other plane - you can see this by writing the planes as $x = 5y-2z+9$ and $x = 5y - 2z$ (a constant shift along $x$ axis)

The blanks in the vectors are: $9, 5, -2$, as the above rewriting describes. $y$ and $z$ can be anything, but then $x$ has to be in a certain relation to them. 

NOTE: this is the same as $x - 5y + 2z = 0$ plane plus $(9,0,0)$. 

Can I write this initial prompt $x - 5y + 2z = 0$ as $Ax = 0$ - yes. 

$$  \begin{bmatrix}1 & -5 & 2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix} = 0$$
So this is just the null space of $A = (1,5,-2)$? It's a plane because $1$ dimension can be written as a linear combination of the others. If I had a rank $2$ matrix, null space would be a line.  In other words - just $1$ pivot. 


#status/ðŸ”ƒ  COME Back after the next lecture. 

#### Digression

We could also write this as $z = -x + \frac{5}{2}y - \frac{9}{2}$. This implies the following: 
$$\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = d_1\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}  + d_2\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 5/2 \end{bmatrix}  + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ -9/2 \end{bmatrix} $$


In other words: $(x,y,z)'$ is either of the following:

$$ \begin{bmatrix}9 & 5 & -2 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\c_1 \\c_2 \end{bmatrix} \; \text{or} \; \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\-1 & 5/2 & -9/2 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}d_1 \\ d_2 \\1  \end{bmatrix}$$
Since these describe the same plane, must they not be the same?

$$ \begin{bmatrix}9 & 5 & -2 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\c_1 \\c_2 \end{bmatrix} \; = \; \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\-1 & 5/2 & -9/2 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}d_1 \\ d_2 \\1  \end{bmatrix}$$
$$\begin{bmatrix}  5c_1 -2 c_2 + 9 \\c_1 \\c_2 \end{bmatrix}\; = \; \begin{bmatrix}d_1 \\ d_2 \\-d_1 + 5d_2/2 -9/2  \end{bmatrix}$$
Let's go back to basics..... 

What is the matrix multiple on the LHS above? It's describing transformations of a vector, $(1, ?, ?)$. This vector can take on a wide array of forms - described by the relative ratio of the coordinates. I can rearrange the ratios to be in terms of any coordinate and still get the same thing.
