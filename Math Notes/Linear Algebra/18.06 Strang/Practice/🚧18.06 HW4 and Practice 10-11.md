## Practice

### Recitation 10

Suppose 
$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\
2 & 1 \\
-1 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 & 3 \\
&1 & 1\\
& & \end{bmatrix}$$
Find the basis and dimension of each of the four fundamental subspaces. 

The row space is easy. Row operations preserve the row space: $L$ encodes row operations that transform $B$ to $U$. So the row space has dimension $2$ and a basis is $(5,0,3)'$ and $(0,1,1)'$. Furthermore, the last row of $L$$\inv$ represents the row operations done to get a zero row; so the left null space, of dimension $1$, has basis $(1,0,1)$.

To get the column space we have to get back to $B$. We know from the row space that it is dimension $2$. 

$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 
5 & 0 & 3 \\
10 & 1 & 7 \\
-5 & 0 & -3 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
We can then say the basis of a column space is $(1,2,-1)'$ and $(0,1,0)$.  The special solution is apparent as $(-3/5, -1,1)$. 

AH

the basis for the column space IS: the pivot columns of $L$????? <font color=#F7B801>Whyyyy</font>

### Practice 10

For there to be no solution for some $Ax = b$, that must mean the matrix has $r \leq n, r < m$. 

The solutions to $A'y = 0$ are the left null space. The dimension of the left null space is $m - r > 0$. So there must be something in it.

This is solvable when $d$ is in the row space, and uniquely solvable when the left null space contains only zero. 

### Recitation 11: Matrix Spaces

Show that the set of $2\times 3$ matrices whose null space contains $[2, 1, 1 ]'$  is a vector space, and find a basis for it. 

What about those whose column space contains $[2,1]'$.


a) We have all matrices $A$ such that $Ax = 0$ if $x = [2,1,1,]'$. Write this latter as $x_0$.
- Closure under scalar multiplication: If $Ax_0 = 0$, then is $cA$ in the space? $cAx_0 = c(Ax_0) = c(0) = 0$.
- Closure under addition: $Ax_0 = 0$ and $Bx_0 = 0$. Then $(A+B)x_0 = Ax_0 + Bx_0 = 0 + 0 = 0$. 

Obviously also contains the origin. 

We can characterize this space as all matrices that have $[2,1,1]'$ as a special solution. Since the latter terms are $1,1$ we know that there is only one free variable. Recall that the special solutions can also be the columns of $\begin{bmatrix} -F & I \end{bmatrix}'$. So we have $F = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & -1\end{bmatrix}'$. in that case we have an RREF that is of this form: 

$$ R = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -2\\ 0 & 1 & -1\end{bmatrix}$$
Any scalar multiple of this will be in the nullspace since $c0 = 0$. 

But we can also have zero rows for either of these, and that would suffice. So: 
$$\text{Basis} = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -2 \\0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & -1 \\0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\1 & 0 & -2 \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right\}$$
Dimension is $4$. 

b) Let $b_1 = [2,1]'$. Then we know that $Ax = b_1$ for some $3 \times 1$ $x$. 
- Scalar multiplication: Let $x' = (1/c)x$. Then we have $cAx' = cA(1/c)x = c(1/c)Ax = b_1$. 
- Addition: 

Consider 

$$ Ax = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2\\1\\0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2\\1\end{bmatrix}= b_1 $$
$$ Bx = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & -1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}-2\\-1\\0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2\\1\end{bmatrix}= b_1 $$
But $A+B$ is the $2 \times 3$. zero matrix, and there is no $x$ such that $0x = b_1$.
