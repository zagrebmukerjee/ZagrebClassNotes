## Practice

### Recitation 10

Suppose 
$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\
2 & 1 \\
-1 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 & 3 \\
&1 & 1\\
& & \end{bmatrix}$$
Find the basis and dimension of each of the four fundamental subspaces. 

The row space is easy. Row operations preserve the row space: $L$ encodes row operations that transform $B$ to $U$. So the row space has dimension $2$ and a basis is $(5,0,3)'$ and $(0,1,1)'$. Furthermore, the last row of $L$' represents the row operations done to get a zero row; so the left null space, of dimension $1$, has basis $(1,0,1)$.

To get the column space we have to get back to $B$. We know from the row space that it is dimension $2$. 

$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 
5 & 0 & 3 \\
10 & 1 & 7 \\
-5 & 0 & -3 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
We can then say the basis of a column space is $(1,2,-1)'$ and $(0,1,0)$.  The special solution is apparent as $(-3/5, -1,1)$. 

AH

the basis for the column space IS: the pivot columns of $L$????? <font color=#F7B801>Whyyyy</font>
