#### [[Video 1 Essence of Linear Algebra]]


Emphasis on _geometric_ interpretation of linear algebra concepts.

Think of an $n$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{v}$ as  a line from the origin to a point in $\mathbb{R}^n$. That point is specified by $\mathbf{v} = v_1, \ldots, v_n$

The core operations of linear algebra are

- the addition of two vectors: $\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}$ means put tail of $\mathbf{w}$ on tip of $\mathbf{v}$. Commutative
- multiplication of a vector by a scalar. For $s \in \mathbb{R}$, $s\mathbf{v} = sv_1 + \dots + sv_n$

Most other operations are constructed from these.
