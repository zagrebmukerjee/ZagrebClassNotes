## Vector Spaces

Continuation of discussion from [[Strang 5. Transposes, Permutations, Vector Spaces#Vector Spaces and Subspaces]]


Note that if $P$ and $L$ are subspaces, then $P \cup L$ is not necessarily a subspace, but $P \cap L$ is. Proof: If $v,w$ are in $P$, then they are in $L$. Then (since $P$ and $L$ are subspaces) it follows that $av + bw$ are in $P$, and that $av + bw$ are in $L$, meaning $av + bw$ are in $P \cap L$.

## Column Spaces

Now we are moving on to vector spaces associated with a particular matrix. 

The <font color=gree>Column Space</font> of a matrix is the space that is made up of all linear combinations of its columns. So, imagine:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} \end{bmatrix}$$
