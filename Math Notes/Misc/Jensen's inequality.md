Suppose $f$ is concave - that is to say $f''<0$. Then:
$$tf(a) + (1-t)f(b) < f(ta + (1-t) b)$$ Other statements:
The secant of a convex (concave) function lies above (below) the functions

If X is a random variable, and $f$ is a convex function, then 
$$E[f(X)] > f(E[X]) $$

Consider the squared mean of a dice-roll - $(4 + 3)^2/2^2$,  $49/4$, or $12.25$, versus the mean of the squares, $\frac{1}{6}[36 + 25 + 16 + 9 + 4+ 1]$ = $91/6 = 15.166$
