# [[Mean Value Theorem]]

## Mean Value Theorem

Suppose $f()$ continuous on $[a,b]$, and differentiable on $(a,b)$. 
Then there exists some $c \in (a,b)$ such that:

$$f'(c) = \frac{f(a)-f(b)}{a-b}$$
In other words: we can approximate $f$ on this interval iwth a line going from $a, f(a)$ to $b, f(b)$. That line has slope $f(a) - f(b)/(a-b)$. There's some point where the derivative of $f$ is parallel to that approximation.

## Mean Value Expansion

Suppose I know that $f(x) = k$, but I don't know $y$. I can say:
$$\begin{align}
\exists c: f'(c) &= \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x-y}\\
(x-y)f'(c) &= k - f(y)\\
k &= (x-y)f'(c) + f(y)\\
\end{align}$$

I might be more able to examine $f'(c)$ than $f(y)$.
