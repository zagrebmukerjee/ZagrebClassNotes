[[Linear Programming]]


## Motivation and Example

Objective: Solve a linear programming problem: that is, maximization of a linear objective function subject to a set of linear-inequality constraints. 


``` ad-example
title: Example Problem
collapse: T

Someone wants to maximize their earnings. They have 12 hours per week to work, and 16 hours per week to prepare. There are two jobs: 
- Job 1 pays $40/hr and requires 2 hours of preparation per hour worked, and 
- Job 2 pays $30/hr and requires 1 hour of prep/hour of work. 

Then this is a linear programming problem. Let $x_1, x_2$ be hours in Jobs 1 and 2. Then: 
Maximize 
$$40x_1 + 30x_2$$
subject to: 
$$ x_1 + x_2 \leq 12$$ 
and 
$$2x_1 + x_2 \leq 16$$


```
