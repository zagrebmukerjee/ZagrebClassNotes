# [[Taylor Series]]
<span style = "font-size:120%"><i >Zagreb Mukerjee </i></span>





Taylor expansion is a local approximation of some arbitrary function as a sum of functions of its derivatives 
in the neighborhood of that point the function is well approximated 

Function $f(x)$ can be real or complex-valued, is infinitely differentiable at $a$. Then the taylor series is 

$$ f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \ldots$$
