Quasilinear utility consumer 
Goods $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ 
$u = x_0  + \sum u_ix_i$ 

Marshallian $d_i$; indirect utility $V(p, E)$ where $p$ is vector
quasilinearity means 
$$V(p, E) = E + \sum_i u_i [d_i(p_i)] - \sum_i p_i d_i(p_i) \equiv E + s(p_i)$$

Good $0$ is produced w labor 1-to-1, is produced everywhere



auction-theoretic solution concept: lobbyist offers menu/ contribution schedule $C(p)$ 

intuitively the optimal contribution is between welfare maximizing (no tariff) and optimal protection




key comparative static; more tariffs on things with _inelastic_ imports: serves the lobbyists but also raises rvenue

Free trade in the model: a stable equilibrium where the lobbies cancel each other out; or if ruler doesn't care about contributions, $\beta=1$
