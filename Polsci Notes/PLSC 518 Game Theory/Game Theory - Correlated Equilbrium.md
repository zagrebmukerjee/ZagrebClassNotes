# [[Game Theory - Correlated Equilbrium]]

[[Game-Theoretic Solution Concepts]]


Correlated equilbrium is a solution concept developed to capture the probability that players may communicate in particular kinds of ways that create 'self-enforcing' equilibria above and beyond any Nash equilibrium. 

## Example: Chicken

Consider the game of Chicken.

### Nash

| Player 1 | Player 2 |          |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|          | Swerve   | Continue |
| Swerve   | 2,2      | 3,0      |
| Continue | 0,3      | -1,-1    |

The game has no pure-strategy Nash Equilibrium. A mixed-strategy NE can be found with the indifference conditions: 

$$\begin{align}
E[u_1(Swerve_1)] &= p \times u_1(Swerve_1, Swerve_2) + (1-p) \times u_1(Swerve_1, Continue_2)\\
&= 2p + 0\\
E[u_1(Continue_1)] &= 3p -(1-p) \\
2p &= 4p - 1 \\
p &= 1/2\\
\end{align}$$
Symmetrically: both players swerve or continue with equal probability. Each square obtains with equal probability; the expected payoff for a player is $2/4 + 3/4 + 0/4 -1/4 = 1$. 

### Correlated
Now, suppose the players acquire a computer program that rolls a die ($d= 1-6$ with equal probability) and communicates to the players *privately* as follows: 

1) Tell Player 1: Swerve if $d \leq 4$, continue otherwise; and 
2) Tell Player 2: Swerve if $d \geq 2$, continue otherwise. 

So if Player 1 hears "Swerve", they know the die says $1,2,3$ or $4$; which means P2 hears $S$ or $C$ with equal probability. Suppose P2 complies: then, 
$$\begin{align}
E[u_1(S_1)| \text{"Swerve"}] &= 1/2 \times E[u_1(S_1, S_2)] + 1/2 \times E[u_1(S_1, C_2)]\\
&= (1/2)(1) + (1/2) (0) = 1/2\\
E[u_1(C_1)| \text{"Swerve"}] &= 1/2 \times E[u_1(C_1, S_2)] + 1/2 \times E[u_1(C_1, C_2)]\\
&=  (1/2)(3) -(1/2)(1) = 1/2
\end{align}$$
Then Player 1 might as well comply. Similar logic gets us what happens if Player 1 hears "Continue": 

In this case, the expected utility of Player 1 from this whole scheme is: 
$$\begin{align}
E[u_1] &= E[u_1| \text{"Swerve"}_1]P(\text{"Swerve"}_1) + E[u_1| \text{"Continue"}_1] P(\text{"Continue"}_1)\\
&= E[u_1| \text{"Swerve"}_1]P(\text{"Swerve"}_1) + E[u_1| \text{"Continue"}_1] P(\text{"Continue"}_1)\\
\end{align}$$
