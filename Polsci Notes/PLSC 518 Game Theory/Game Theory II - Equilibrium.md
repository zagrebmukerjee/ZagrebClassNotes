## Nash Equilibrium

A Nash Equilibrium is a particular kind of solution concept for a game. Intuitively it represents a situation where nobody can benefit from changing their strategy while others keep doing the same thing. 

$s^* = (s_1^*, s_2^*, \ldots)$ is a Pure Strategy Nash Equilbrlim if $\forall$ players $i$, $\not \exists s_i'$: $u_i(s_i', s^*_{-i}) > u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*)$. 

NOTE the strict inequality. can have indifference

Corollary: A Nash equilibrium necessitates no player is playing a strictly dominated strategy. 

The classic example is prisoner's dilemma:

|         | Confess | Silent  |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Confess | -4, -4  | -2, -10 |
| Silent  | -10, -2 | -3, -3  | 

NE is that both players confess. Both silent is not NE; either player is better off confessing. 

There can be more than 1 NE
|      | Left | Right |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Up   | 2, 2 | 0,0  |
| Down | 0,0  | 1,1  |
Here both up, left and down, right are NE. 

## Mixed Strategy Equilibrium

Consider this game:

|      | odd  | even   |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| odd  | 1,0  | 0,1    |
| even | -c,1 | 1-c, 0 | 

No pure strategy equilibrium exists. 

One of Nash's major contributions was to point out that players aren't restricted to pure strategies; they can instead construct a randomization rule. 

Does such a randomization rule exist? 

For that to be true, we need an indifference condition. I need everyone else's randomization strategy to satisfy a condition that would make me indifferent between options.

## Public Goods Problem

Canonical problem in political science. Someone being murdered outside your apartment building. Some cost $c$ to calling the police. If anyone calls the police there is a collective benefit - everyone gets $1$. The good is nonexcludable. 

$n$ players decide to call or not call. Payoff is $1-c$ if you make call. $1$ if someone else does. $0$ otherwise.
- If $c < 1$ then there is an NE when any one person is calling - so $n$ of them. 
- But what about coordination? 
	- What's the internal story - how does everyone else know that the caller is calling
	- How do you decide who is calling - which of the $n$ are we playing. 

Game theory lingo: These equilibria are very <font color=gree>asymmetric</font>. There's nothing in the model that tells you why some particular person is calling. Why did you pick this one?

But none of the <font color=gree>symmetric</font> profiles are NE for $n>1$ (ie. nobody calls or everyone calls). 

So if I want a symmetric equilibrium, I am SOL? Let's look at symmetric mixed strategies. 

Suppose a player chooses some $\sigma_i$. I require that all $\sigma_i = \sigma$ for symmetry. I require that each player be indifferent between calling and not based on others' $\sigma$. 

For some $i$, I have $E(u_i|s_i = \text{call}) = 1-c$. I have $E(u_i|s_i = \text{no call}) = 1-(1 - \sigma)^n$. So I need $1 - (1- \sigma)^{n-1} = 1-c$; and so $\sigma = 1 - c^{1/(n-1)}$. 

Don't need to solve it to say that some $\sigma$ exists (given $0 < c < 1$) 0 can establish that $\sigma = 0$ has RHS $0$, and $\sigma = 1$ has RHS $1$. So I can say something exists by the intermediate value theorem. This is a sort of comparative static - I'm interested in how the result varies with $c$ and $n$, or I am interested in making inference about $c$ and $n$ having made observations of $\sigma$ 

Note! Equilibrium condition is $1-c = (1- (1-\sigma)^{n-1})$. LHS is probability of public good being provided. It stays constant in $n$ - by this condition. So public good provision is the same in kansas and NYC. I can make this claim without solving for $\sigma$. 

### Complexity

In the last problem we said it takes any $1$ person to call to obtain the good. now we say that we need $k$ people to make the call (where $k < n$). There are still PSNE - $k$ players call - but they are still asymmetric. This time though, there is a symmetric NE: nobody calls. 


## Nash Existence Theorem

### Setup

Suppose $N$ finite, and $S_i$ finite for each $i \in N$. 

A mixed strategy for $i \in N$ is a lottery over $S_i$. Suppose $S_i = (s_1, s_2, \ldots s_K)$. Then $\sum^K \sigma_k$ is $1$. This constraint looks like some sort of $n$-dimensional equivalents of the tetrahedron $z = 1 - x - y$. Call this a simplex: then we can say $\sigma_i$, some mixed strategy, is a vector that lies on the $d-1$ dimensional simplex $\Delta(S_i)$. 

Write $\sigma^* = (\sigma_1^*, \sigma^*_2, \ldots)$. Then I need $\sigma_i^* \in b(\sigma^*_{-1})$: my strategy has to be a best-response to everyone else's mixed strategy 

Define $b(\sigma) = [b_1(\sigma_{-1}), \ldots, b_N(\sigma_{-N})]$. This is the best response for each player conditional on others playing $\sigma$ (some vector). Then $\sigma^*$ is an MSNE if $\sigma^* \in b(\sigma^*)$. This is a <font color=gree>fixed point</font> (a point that some function maps to itself)

Simplex is closed, bounded, convex. We can let $K \to \infty$ without too much difficulty. 

Key question. Is $b_i(\sigma_{-i})$ a function? We have frequently had best-response correspondences. 


### Kakutani's Fixed Point Theorem
- if $A$ is compact, convex nonempty set (for our purposes, compact being closed and bounded on RN by heine-borel thm)
- and $C$ is an [[Micro Theory IIIb - Hemicontinuity|upper hemicontinuous]] convex valued correspondence
- then $C: A \to A$ has a fixed point. 


In our case, $A$ is the set of simplexes $\Delta S_i$ and so on - the sets of possible randomization strategies. $A$ is nonempty, compact, convex. 

Convex-valued function makes sense. If I am indifferent between mixed strategies $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ I should be indifferent between any linear combination of the two. And if $\sigma \in b(\cdot)$ and $\sigma' \sim \sigma$, $\sigma' \in b(\cdot)$.
