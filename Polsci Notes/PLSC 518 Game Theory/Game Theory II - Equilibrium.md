## Nash Equilibrium

A Nash Equilibrium is a particular kind of solution concept for a game. Intuitively it represents a situation where nobody can benefit from changing their strategy while others keep doing the same thing. 

$s^* = (s_1^*, s_2^*, \ldots)$ is a Pure Strategy Nash Equilbrlim if $\forall$ players $i$, $\not \exists s_i$: $u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*)$
