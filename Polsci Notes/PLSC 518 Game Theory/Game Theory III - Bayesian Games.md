![[Game Theory II - Equilibrium#Problem Formulation]]

We all know each others' costs, and we all know that we know etc. 







# Scratch

Second price auctions we did. 

First price auction. Uniformly distributed valuations on $[0,1]$.

Strategy for 1. What's the probability I win with bid x? Assume that $b(v)$ is strictly increasing for other players (this could be shown). 

It's $P(b_2, \ldots, b_{n-1} < x)$. What's the probability that $P(b_i(v_i) < x)$ for any given $i$? Rearrange the condition to say $v_i < b\inv(x)$. I know the distribution of $v_i$. 

Two ways to approach this. 
1) easier but requires guessing
2) longer no guessing

Suppose I can say that $P(1 \text{ wins with bid } x)$ = $(x/q)^{n-1}$. Then I have $\max_x EU_1 (x, v) = (v-x)(x/q)^{n-1}$. Differentiate to get $-(x/q)^{n-1} + (v-x)(n-1)(x/q)^{n-2} = 0$. $(x/q)^{n-1} = (v-x)(n-1)(x/q)^{n-2}$ and so $x = v(n-1)/n$

If everyone else is playing a linear strategy, I want to play one too. I don't care about their coefficients, incidentally. So this looks like a great equilibrium.
