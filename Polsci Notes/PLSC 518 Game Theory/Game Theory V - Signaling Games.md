# [[Game Theory V - Signaling Games]]

## Foundation

Two new concepts that we are introducing. 

#### Learning
Players using [[2002.1 Probability|Bayes' Rule]]. I have uncertainty about something eg behaviors. I want to condition and learn. 

#### Conjecture and Check
I need to conjecture a about what the players do, and then check if that makes sense strategically
- often I will find a profitable deviation.

Shoot the Messenger Game 


![[Game Theory V - Signaling Games 2022-11-15 15.44.30.excalidraw]]

Basic game setup. Nature chooses state of the world. Player 2 needs to take a policy action to match state of the world but doesn't observe state. Player 1 needs to say something, having observed the state, and wants P2 to match; but player 1 pays a cost for saying state is bad


Need two strategies: 
1) Player 1 has mapping from $\{$ Good State, Bad State $\}$ to $\{$ "Good", "Bad"$\}$
2) Player 2 has from $\{$ "Good", "Bad"$\}$ to $\{$ Act, Not Act $\}$



what is rationality here? It's for player 2 to act in a way that makes sense given the 'information they have': beliefs. 
In this case, P2 has beliefs that are $P(\omega | \text{"good"})$, and $P(\omega | \text{"bad"})$ . 

Where do I get them? [[2002.1 Probability|Bayes' Rule]]
 $$ P(\omega = \text{bad}| s_1 = \text{"bad"}) = \frac{(1-\pi)P(s_1 = \text{"bad"}|\omega = \text{bad})}{(1-\pi)P(s_1 = \text{"bad"}|\omega = \text{bad}) + \pi P(s_1 = \text{"bad"}|\omega = \text{good})}$$


### Perfect Bayesian Equilibria

So equilibrium will be: 
- Strategies are sequentially rational given beliefs
- beliefs satisfy Bayes' rule. 

how to find this sort of thing: conjecture a rule for player 1, then check to see if it satisfies PBE condition

First supposition: report truthfully. 

then what is belief: 
$$P(\omega = \text{good}| s_1 = \text{"good"})  = \frac{(1-\pi)P(s_1 = \text{"good"}|\omega = \text{good})}{(1-\pi)P(s_1 = \text{"good"}|\omega = \text{good}) + \pi P(s_1 = \text{"good"}|\omega = \text{bad})} =  \frac{(1-\pi)}{1-\pi} =1$$
similarly $P(\omega = b|s_1 = g) = 0$. 

So then act if $s_1 = g'$ else don't. 
But does p1 want to play this strategy, given that response? 
Well, if $c > 1$, then when true state is good, I prefer still to lie and have the bad outcome. but if $c \leq 1$ then I am all set. this is eqm. Are there others?


WHat about $s_1 = g'$ always?

Then player 2 has no information from this loser. so beliefs = prior if player 1 says good $\pi$. If not good, denominator is $0$ and so there's no information on beliefs. I have to pick a number. 
- why does it matter? because some choice of strategy might make player 1 decide strategy not rational. 
- so what are the choices of this value for which P1 will not change their strategy
- this is conceptually troubling but we can shelve for now
