# [[PLSC 705 2 Efficiency]]

Different ideas of efficiency  in economcs: 
- technological efficiency. An allocation of resources to technologies is tE iff there is no other allocation that could produce a vector that elementwise is at least as good in all goods and better in at least one. 
	- Data: production functions and endowments of inputs
	- Neither preferences nor prices are invoked
- Distributive efficiency
	- endowments of goods, preferences
	- DE iff there is no other feasible allocation that is at least as good for all consumers and better for at least one 
- Pareto efficiency
	- production functions, endowments of inputs, preferences of consumers
	- Allocation to resources/inputs to technologies, and of resulting commodities/goods to consumers, is pareto efficient if no other configuration of inputs can create a more distributively efficient output.
