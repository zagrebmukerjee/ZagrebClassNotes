# [[PLSC 705 Fundamental Economic Concepts]]

Rationality
- Not self-interest related
- Purely instrumental formulation: I try to maximize | my preferences
- preferences come from wherever
- your preferences may or may not be "good for you" -> difference btwn liberalism, paternalism. 
	- whether we ask this question depends on our orientation towards the normative or the positive <font color=#F7B801>ah yes, the famously positive economists like Milton Friedman and Larry Summers</font>

Methodological individualism cf [[Micro Theory I - Representing Choice]]
- Orientation towards the individual and individual choice as a tool for explanation
- _Reductionist_ in the sense of demanding individual-level explanations. Contrast with structural, holist, functionalist. <font color=#F7B801>or don't</font>
- M.Indiv does not require assuming rationality. Can analyze the actions of individuals according to several different motivation structures: rationality; emotion; norm-driven; duty-driven <font color=#F7B801>bah</font>

Distinguish so-called 'rational choice' approaches that assume self-interest. That name is just marketing

Can also distinguish mathematical formalism from both M.Indiv and rationality; often seen together, but not necessarily. Modeling is based on choosing what's important and discarding what is not. <font color=#F7B801>As is everything else</font>

Mathematics is useful because - and inasmuch as - it augments the capacity of basic logic/plain language. If you write a model and produce nothing that you couldn't have with the 'naked mind', throw out the model. 

Modeling is art and we will learn it thru practice




Different ideas of efficiency in economcs: 
- technological efficiency. An allocation of resources to technologies is tE iff there is no other allocation that could produce a vector that elementwise is at least as good in all goods and better in at least one. 
	- Data: production functions and endowments of inputs
	- Neither preferences nor prices are invoked
- Distributive efficiency
	- endowments of goods, preferences
	- DE iff there is no other feasible allocation that is at least as good for all consumers and better for at least one 
- Pareto efficiency
	- production functions, endowments of inputs, preferences of consumers
	- Allocation to resources/inputs to technologies, and of resulting commodities/goods to consumers, is pareto efficient if no other configuration of inputs can create a more distributively efficient output. 


Pareto efficiency necessitates both TE and DE. 

Note that none of this is market-embedded. Neither prices nor transactions are involved in defining rationality.
