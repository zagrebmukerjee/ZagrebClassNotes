## Zagreb's Class Notes

These are notes I've taken in a variety of classes, transcribed into markdown and occasionally rendered to PDF. 
It's a habit I acquired sometime in college - I find it's a great tool for synthesizing what I have learned, and testing my own understanding. 
I think of it as writing a very rough and terse draft of a textbook.
As Feynman said, "If you want to master something, teach it."


#### Classes

1. [Econ 1123](https://github.com/zagrebmukerjee/ZagrebClassNotes/tree/master/Econ%20Notes/Econ%201123%20Notes), Harvard Introductory Econometrics. The fundamentals are complete; missing discussion of specific topics like diff-in-diff, panel data. I probably won't update this
2. [Gov 2001](https://github.com/zagrebmukerjee/ZagrebClassNotes/tree/master/Stats%20Notes/Gov%202001%20Notes), Harvard Quantitative Methods I. Overview of quantitative methods. Largely complete. 
3. [Linear Algebra 3B1B](https://github.com/zagrebmukerjee/ZagrebClassNotes/tree/master/Math%20Notes/Linear%20Algebra%203B1B%20Notes): Introduction to Linear Algebra by 3Blue1Brown on Youtube. A high-level but thoughtful coverage of the topic. I recommend it as a companion to an LA class. Mostly complete.
4. [Gov 2002](https://github.com/zagrebmukerjee/ZagrebClassNotes/tree/master/Stats%20Notes/Gov%202002%20Notes), Harvard Quantitative Methods II. Mid-level econometrics class with Gov focus. In progress
5. 18.06, MIT Linear Algebra. Taught by Gilbert Strang, available on [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/). In progress

To be added: Econ 1011a, Honors Microeconomic Theory, once I find it.

#### Notes on Content

The markdown is all made with [Obsidian](obsidian.md), which I thoroughly endorse for simplicity, portability, and extensibility. Should you decide to set up your own Obsidian vault(s), feel free to include these, or potentially reference them by submodule etc.

I mostly write these as notes to a theoretical future myself. They tend to be slightly less terse than the average lecture slides: 
I use more words and work through proofs, exercises etc. a little more slowly. Sometimes I go on long tangents. I try to put these in different
files, or enclose them with colored boxes.
