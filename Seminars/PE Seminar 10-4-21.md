# [[PE Seminar 10-4-21]]

Jose Morales-Arilla:

Why do dictators economically preference their own regions? It's not obviously the right thing to do strategically - could want to appease your enemies or strengthen your base

Strategy: economic shocks should magnify strategic motives, so shocks shd reveal underyling strategic motives

Hypothesis: minimize the shock on your supporters in shock times. have to appease someone -> choose supporters (Why?)

<font color="red">he's saying the shock moves the regime's frontier inward so they have to make tradeoffs. but why isn't that true even at the old frontier? It seems like you'd need a nonlinearity in benefits from  supporting a region </font>

two empirical tests: venezuelan blackouts 2019, power rationing, but supporter regions were exempt. Exempted regions did not experience spike in protest

subsaharan africa: rainfall shocks - droughts magnify differences in development, protest/repressions in favor of regime-affiliated regions

Model: 

Regime chooses appeasement for supporters, appeasement for opponents, repression. All are costly.

Then opposition and supporters choose to revolt or not


legislative supermajority purchasing game - american

IR - minimum winning coalition for public good provision



why can't you write a paper without the shock
