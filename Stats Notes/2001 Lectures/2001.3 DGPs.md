## [[2001.3 DGPs]]
Part of [[@Stats Index]]



### Data Generation Processes

If we have data, we want to know where it came from. Otherwise it's not useful. Models are trying to learn about the DGP. Bern(.5) can be a model of flipping a fair coin. 

This is a place where theory and data can inform each other

Always useful to think about

##### Simulation 

It's great for:
1) understanding a DGP
2) Solving probability problems
3) Evaluate estimators
	1) eg: you can create a probability model, draw data from that world, apply your estimator, and see if you get the (known) parameter back. 
4) Calculate properties of densities 
5) Compute and visualize QOIs
6) Get the right answer easier than math


It's like a survey - except instead of sampling the population, you can sample from your model. And it's free.
