#### Review
1) describe your QOI
2) measure your QOI
3) estimate uncertainty
4) Validate your measure

QOI can be a concept or a relationship
if a relationship: you need a model that describes the relationship

Model:
- Model notation standard
- should correspond to reality

Then u measure model variables, params etc against observed outcomes



Need to validate measure - correct for its shortcomings, try out of sample, etc


To be convincing:
- you have to pick a main measure or model to be the core of your paper
- You want to defend your assumptions substantively to skeptics.
- Validate your measures or models (and put it in the appendix)
