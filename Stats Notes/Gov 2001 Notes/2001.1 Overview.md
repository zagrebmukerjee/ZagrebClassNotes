## [[2001.1 Overview]]


Methodology is very young 
The best methods are invented near the applications

huge changes in social science evidence base
from surveys, end of period govt stats, one-off studies of ppl places or events
to new types of data, big data, etc

previously quant dissertation: download from common source
now quant dissertations, most generate new data and learn or develop methods to suit

poli sci is a diverse discipline. great place for a broad perspective on methods
