Inference is finding things we don't know using things we do know

#### Bayes Theorem
Definition of conditional probability: based on joint probability $P(\theta, y)$

$$\begin{align}
P(\theta|y) &= \frac{P(\theta,y)}{P(y)}\\
&= \frac{P(\theta)P(y|\theta)}{P(y)}\\
&= \frac{P(\theta)P(y|\theta)}{\int P(\theta)P(y|\theta)d\theta}\\
\end{align}
$$
