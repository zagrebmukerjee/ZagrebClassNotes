# [[2002.1 Basic Probability Review]]
Part of [[@Stats Index]]


### Foundations and notation

Basic idea is _sample space_ $\Omega$ - all the things that can happen. This can be pretty abstract e.g. all the outcomes an experiment could have had.

An _event_ is a subset of the sample space eg. $A, B \subseteq \Omega$ 
A probability function is a mapping $A \to P$ where $0 \le P \le 1$ that is defined for all $A \subseteq \Omega$.  

Probability of one event $P(A)$ is a _marginal probability_.

The probability of two events both happening - the intersection of the events - is a _joint probability_ $P(A \cap B)$.

Probability of one of $A$ or $B$ happening - the union of the events - is $P(A \cup B)$.


Probability functions observe the Kolmogorov axioms:
- Non-negativity $P(A) >0 \; \forall A$
- Normalization  $P(\Omega) = 1$
- Additivity - if $A \cap B = \emptyset$ then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

- We could construct something more rigorous with measure theory, but I don't know how, and I don't think I need to 

##### Multiple Events

Given $P(A \cap B)$ and $P(B)$ we can create a new idea - $P(A | B)$, a _conditional probability_.

This can be interpreted as the probability of event $A$, given the knowledge that event $B$ has occurred. It is defined as 
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$

This imples that $P(A \cap B) = P(B)P(A|B)$.

Given this definition, we can create:

##### Law of Total Probability

Let $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ be a partition of $\Omega$ - that is, $\bigcup A_i = \Omega$ and  $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset \; \forall i,j$.

Then, for any event $B \subseteq \Omega$, $$P(B) = P(A_1 \cap B) + P(A_2 \cap B) + \ldots + P(A_n \cap B)$$

Equivalently, 
$$P(B) = P(A_1)P(B|A_1) + \ldots + P(A_n)P(B|A_n)$$

##### Bayes' Rule

We know that $P(A|B) = P(A\cap B)/P(B)$, and $P(A \cap B) = P(B \cap A) = P(A)P(B|A)$. Substituting: 
$$ P(A|B)  = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} P(B|A)$$


##### Independence

Two events are independent -
