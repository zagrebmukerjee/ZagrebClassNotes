1. Precisely interpret the coefficient on 'black'

The coefficient means that, all else equal, I would expect a black person in the scope of this study to make $2173 less than a white person.

2. Precisely interpret the coefficient on 'log re74'
The coefficient means that, all else equal, a  $10\%$ increase in 1974 income is associated with an $8.5 increase in 
4. What is the $t$ statistic for the null hypothesis that $\beta_2$ is $0$
5. True or false - the $F$ statistic in the table means that we reject the null hypothesis that all the coefficients in the model are equal to $0$
6. True or false? Suppose the  true model of real earnings  in 1978 doesnâ€™t depend on  
race. Including the variable  therefore induces bias in our  estimates of the regression  coefficients.
6. Looking at Model 2, express the marginal effect of treatment in terms of the coefficients and variables. 
7. What is the variance of the marginal effect?
8. A classmate proposes you test the null hypothesis $\beta_2 = \beta_4$. Write the appropriate test statistic based on the information in Model 2.
